# SKCS Edge Control Center

**Generated:** 2026-07-05
**Ledger:** `control-center/EDGE_BUILD_CONTROL_LEDGER.v1.json`
**Check command:** `npm run control:center`

---

> **Scout ↔ Edge marriage remains BLOCKED. Edge Control Center v1 exists to govern the deferred integration, Supabase storage, security, prediction integrity, and external-provider removal before the two systems are connected.**

---

## 1. Edge architectural law

| System | Canonical responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Scout** | Governed sports truth, acquisition, evidence, history, weather truth, availability truth, sports context, H2H evidence, FIP assembly and FIP validation |
| **Edge/Test** | FIP consumption, prediction analysis, probability/scoring, contextual adjustment, market interpretation, filtering, direct prediction logic, ACCA construction, explanation, publication, users and subscribers |
| **Scout database** | Neon |
| **Edge/Test database** | Supabase |
| **Sports truth direction** | Scout → validated FIP boundary → Edge |
| **Subscriber/commercial direction** | Remains inside Edge/Supabase |
| **Raw Scout evidence mirror in Supabase** | Forbidden by default |
| **Full FIP permanent retention in Supabase** | Gated |
| **FIP reference/hash with derived Edge outputs** | Preferred design subject to EST-001 |

Scout and Edge are intentionally separate systems.

The integration bridge was deliberately deferred while Scout's governance, builders, FIP contract, validation, evidence archive, routing, and project-control foundations were stabilized.

The current project is not the discovery of a forgotten bridge.

It is the governed resumption of the intentionally deferred Scout ↔ Edge integration.

---

## 2. Current Edge state

| Dimension | Status |
|---|---|
| **Edge Control Center v1** | DONE |
| **Edge Master Project Register** | TESTED |
| **Full Edge system/runtime inventory** | TESTED |
| **Scout ↔ Edge marriage gate** | BLOCKED |
| **Supabase storage gate** | BLOCKED |
| **External sports provider removal** | PARTIAL |
| **FIP intake handshake** | PROPOSED |
| **Subscriber/security boundary inventory** | PROPOSED |
| **Prediction pipeline integrity inventory** | PROPOSED |
| **Scout → Edge end-to-end proof** | BLOCKED |

---

## 3. Why the marriage gate is blocked

The following technical prerequisites must be satisfied:

| ID | Prerequisite | Current state |
|---|---|---|
| EMG-001 | Scout-Edge Marriage Gate Contract | PROPOSED |
| EFI-001 | FIP Intake Handshake | PROPOSED |
| EST-001 | Supabase Storage and FIP Retention Contract | PROPOSED |
| ESEC-001 | Subscriber and Security Boundary | PROPOSED |
| EPI-001 | Prediction Pipeline Integrity | PROPOSED |
| EPRV-001 | External Sports Provider Removal | PARTIAL |
| E2E-001 | Scout to Edge End-to-End Proof | BLOCKED |

Even when all technical prerequisites are TESTED, COMMITTED, or DONE, `scout_edge_marriage_gate` requires separate explicit approval.

The gate does not auto-clear.

---

## 4. Current provider-removal state

Phase 1 removed selected public/direct provider surfaces and provider-heartbeat startup.

However Edge still has reachable direct sports-acquisition origins.

Known evidence includes:

`backend/services/aiPipeline.js`
→ `getPredictionInputs()`
→ `backend/services/dataProvider.js`
→ `buildLiveData()`
→ external provider acquisition

Additional acquisition surfaces have been identified in:

- `backend/services/contextIngestionService.js`
- `backend/services/contextEnrichmentService.js`
- `backend/services/footballHighlightsService.js`
- `scripts/import-today-snapshot-pipeline.js`

Therefore:

**SCOUT-SOLE-PROVIDER STATE: PARTIAL**

Provider removal must not resume by blindly deleting mixed analysis/acquisition files.

EFI-001 must first define the governed FIP input origin.

---

## 5. Supabase storage law

Edge/Test operates under a constrained Supabase storage budget of approximately 0.5 GB.

The Scout ↔ Edge bridge must not create a second Scout evidence database inside Supabase.

The following distinction is mandatory:

### Transport

What intelligence crosses from Scout to Edge for processing?

### Retention

What subset of that intelligence must Edge permanently retain?

These are separate architecture decisions.

Preferred direction:

Scout FIP
→ Edge intake validation
→ transient analysis input
→ Edge prediction/scoring/explanation
→ Supabase retains derived Edge state plus canonical FIP reference/provenance/hash

Do not permanently copy Scout raw evidence, historical evidence, source archives, or full intelligence history into Supabase by default.

EST-001 owns the final contract.

## 7. Current execution rule

Do not resume architecture implementation from conversation memory alone.

The Control Center ledger determines the current state.

The Master Project Register will become the canonical inventory of Edge projects and subprojects.

Before implementation:

1. confirm the project exists in the register
2. confirm dependencies
3. inspect current state
4. approve the task separately when required
5. implement only the approved boundary
6. require proof
7. update project state

## 8. Prior sequencing note

Previous allowed startable task snapshot:

EPR-001 closure state:

**EPR-001 — Edge Master Project Register [TESTED]**

Mode:

**IMPLEMENT EPR-001 TESTED PROMOTION ONLY**

Purpose:

Implement the approved Master Project Register + Repository Asset Register foundation only, without performing Scout/FIP intake implementation, provider removal, Supabase mutation, or prediction-rule changes.
Completion contract:
Current tracked coverage evidence is:
- 898 tracked paths
- 898 registered tracked assets
- 0 unclassified tracked paths

This is complete tracked repository coverage. It is not complete local workspace visibility.

Current discovery evidence also identified:
- 40 non-ignored pre-existing untracked workspace paths
- 0 currently registered or explicitly excluded in the asset register
- 40 outside the current asset register boundary

Pre-existing untracked workspace candidates must be discovered separately from tracked repository assets. The underlying untracked artifact does not need to be committed merely to preserve governed evidence that the path was observed. Every discovered pre-existing untracked candidate must be preserved as governed workspace candidate evidence or explicitly excluded with a reason.

Current rule/governance candidate evidence identified:
- 35 total candidate paths
- 34 tracked
- 1 pre-existing untracked

Known first-party rule and governance authority candidates remain identifiable by review role, but this proves inventory visibility rather than a connected authority-review graph:
- 34 tracked candidates currently authority UNKNOWN
- 34 tracked candidates currently owner UNRESOLVED
- 34 tracked candidates governed by EPR-001
- 34 tracked candidates currently have empty related_assets

Candidate status does not establish CURRENT_AUTHORITY. Candidate relationship edges are review relationships, not authority precedence. A candidate with no relationship edge must be explicitly identified as a standalone review candidate with a non-empty reason. Ignored dependency, environment, and cache paths are not first-party authority candidates merely because their names contain rule/governance terms. Final rule/governance authority remains subject to governed review.

UNRESOLVED final project ownership may remain as a non-fatal governed cleanup finding only when the asset remains bound to a valid Control Center task and has a non-empty `next_validation`. EPR-001 is closed and TESTED in this step.

Do not start FIP intake.

Do not resume provider removal.

Do not change Supabase schema.

Do not clear the marriage gate.

## 8. Stateful Control Center gate — Repository Cleanup Programme

All AI instructions are proposals.

ChatGPT, Codex, Cursor, and other AI instructions require Control Center GREEN before execution.

The gate is stateful. It does not use keyword or phrase detection to decide GREEN or HOLD.

### Governing principle

ONE QUESTION ACROSS THE REPOSITORY AT A TIME.

Complete one approved cleanup phase across all applicable governed assets and all applicable EAC-001 batches.

Close that phase.

Only then activate the next phase.

Do not mix cleanup questions.

Do not drift into another phase because an agent notices a different issue.

Any out-of-phase finding must be recorded as `FUTURE_PHASE_NOTE` and the active phase must continue.

### Existing EAC-001 evidence law

EAC-001 skim/classification is existing repository evidence and must be reused.

The Control Center must not require an implementation agent to rediscover every asset from zero or repeat full initial classification before a later cleanup phase.

A later phase may inspect additional evidence only for the exact question asked by that phase.

### Primary lifecycle (phase and batch oriented)

Required lifecycle states:

- PHASE_PENDING
- PHASE_ACTIVE
- BATCH_ACTIVE
- BATCH_COMPLETE
- PHASE_READY_TO_CLOSE
- PHASE_CLOSED

Required modes:

- PHASE_WORK
- COMPLETE_BATCH
- CLOSE_PHASE
- RECORD_FUTURE_PHASE_NOTE
- CONTROL

The old per-asset forensic lifecycle (`PENDING` → `INSPECTING` → `DISPOSITION_READY` → `CLOSURE_READY` → `CLOSED` with five evidence areas for every asset) is historical only.

It is no longer the mandatory primary lifecycle for the repository cleanup mission.

Per-asset evidence may still exist where useful.

It must not force a full forensic lifecycle for every file during Phase 1.

### Ordered cleanup phases

1. PHASE_0 — REPOSITORY BASELINE AND CONTROL
   Question: What exact repository state is the cleanup programme starting from?
   No cleanup. No repair. No duplicate removal.

2. PHASE_1 — EXACT DUPLICATE ELIMINATION
   Question: Are any governed files byte-for-byte identical?
   Preferred first-pass: local deterministic hashing (for example SHA-256).
   Exact duplicate means byte-for-byte identical content. Similar code, same purpose, same file name, or generated similarity are not exact duplicates.
   Phase 1 may remove only proven exact duplicates after a quick path/reference safety check.
   Phase 1 does not require purpose, runtime-use, dependency, overlap, reuse-value, merge, retirement, or replacement evidence for every unique file.

3. PHASE_2 — FILE PURPOSE IDENTIFICATION
   Question: What does each remaining governed file represent?
   Reuse EAC-001. No merge, deletion, retirement, repair, or refactoring.

4. PHASE_3 — ACTIVE USE IDENTIFICATION
   Question: Is each remaining governed file currently used?
   Outcomes: ACTIVE, INDIRECTLY_ACTIVE, MANUAL_USE, NO_CURRENT_USE_FOUND, UNKNOWN.
   NO_CURRENT_USE_FOUND does not authorise deletion.

5. PHASE_4 — LEGACY AND REPLACEMENT IDENTIFICATION
   Question: Has each applicable file been superseded or left behind by a newer implementation?
   Outcomes: CURRENT, LEGACY, REPLACED, HISTORICAL, UNCERTAIN.

6. PHASE_5 — FUNCTIONAL OVERLAP IDENTIFICATION
   Question: Are different remaining files doing the same or substantially overlapping job?
   Outcomes: NO_OVERLAP, PARTIAL_OVERLAP, MAJOR_OVERLAP, POTENTIAL_MERGE_GROUP.
   Identifies overlap only. No merge implementation.

7. PHASE_6 — CANONICAL AUTHORITY SELECTION
   Question: Which Phase 5 overlap candidate families should have canonical authority selected?
   Outcomes: CANONICAL_AUTHORITY_SELECTED, KEEP_SEPARATE, BLOCKED.
   Selects canonical authority only. No merge, deletion, retirement, refactor, or implementation.

8. PHASE_7 — MERGE AND CONSOLIDATION
   Question: Which confirmed canonical authority decisions should be implemented through merge and consolidation?
   Implementation phase for approved Phase 6 canonical authority decisions only.

9. PHASE_8 — FINAL REPOSITORY VALIDATION
   Question: Is the cleaned repository internally consistent?
   Do not start a new cleanup hunt.

### Phase order law

Allowed sequence: PHASE_0 → PHASE_1 → PHASE_2 → PHASE_3 → PHASE_4 → PHASE_5 → PHASE_6 → PHASE_7 → PHASE_8.

A later phase must not activate while an earlier phase is incomplete.

### Active phase law

The Control Center must expose exactly one active repository cleanup phase.

An implementation agent must be able to determine:

- active phase
- active phase question
- active phase scope
- active batch where applicable
- completed batches
- remaining batches
- phase status
- phase Definition of Done
- future phase notes

The Control Center must fail closed if an agent attempts work belonging to a different cleanup phase.

### Batch law

Reuse the existing deterministic EAC-001 batch manifest (`control-center/EDGE_ASSET_CLASSIFICATION_BATCHES.v1.json`, B01–B29).

Do not invent a second arbitrary batch system.

Where a phase is batch-oriented, process deterministic EAC-001 batches in the existing defined order unless the Control Center records an explicit evidence-backed exception.

The next incomplete batch is the next default batch.

### Phase 1 forbidden questions

During PHASE_1 do not investigate as active work:

- What is this file for?
- Is this file old/legacy/unused/replaced?
- Can different files be merged?
- Do different files overlap?
- Is the code good / should it be refactored?
- Is there a defect / should it be repaired?
- Should the architecture be redesigned?

If noticed: record `FUTURE_PHASE_NOTE` with asset path(s), brief issue, and likely future phase. Continue Phase 1. Do not investigate the note during Phase 1.

### No cross-phase drift law

During an active phase: do the active phase only.

An agent noticing another problem must not investigate it deeply, repair it, refactor it, merge it, retire it, or change architecture because of it.

Record a `FUTURE_PHASE_NOTE` and continue the active phase.

### Standing Git authority

Stephen grants standing repository authority for approved Control Center cleanup phases to perform routine Git inspection, scoped staging, verified batch/phase commits, and push of successfully verified committed work without requesting separate approval from Stephen for each routine Git step.

Allowed without asking Stephen again when the work is inside the active approved phase, the batch/unit is complete, required focused verification passed, unrelated changes are preserved, staged changes contain only approved phase work, and scope is confirmed before commit:

- git status / git status --short
- git diff / git diff --check
- git log / git show / git rev-parse / git ls-files / git grep
- git add -- &lt;exact approved phase/batch paths&gt;
- git commit
- git push origin main

Git actions still requiring Stephen's explicit approval:

- git reset --hard
- git clean
- discarding local work with git checkout / git restore
- git rebase
- merging branches
- force push / git push --force
- branch deletion
- history rewriting
- mass repository rollback
- any Git action that would knowingly discard unrelated local changes

Repository standing Git authority does not override a mandatory IDE, sandbox, OS, or product security approval prompt.

### Gate mode rules

PHASE_WORK may receive GREEN only when the requested phase equals the active phase, the work matches the active phase question, and (for batch-oriented phases) the batch is the next incomplete deterministic EAC-001 batch or the recorded active batch.

COMPLETE_BATCH may receive GREEN only for the active batch of the active phase and must not require unique files to enter the old full forensic lifecycle.

CLOSE_PHASE may receive GREEN only when the active phase Definition of Done is met and phase status is PHASE_READY_TO_CLOSE.

RECORD_FUTURE_PHASE_NOTE may receive GREEN when it records an out-of-phase finding without changing the active phase.

CONTROL may receive GREEN only when:

- Stephen explicitly authorizes Control Center maintenance
- a proven Control Center defect or lifecycle gap is recorded
- scope is confined to Control Center gate, policy, and focused tests
- no product asset is changed

No instruction or missing state = HOLD.

Feature work, unrelated cleanup, broad repository work, premature mutation, or wrong-phase work = HOLD.

Startable ledger tasks remain informational only and do not authorize cleanup-phase execution by themselves.

### Historical Control Center evidence (preserved)

The following records are preserved historical evidence from the previous per-asset forensic investigation model. They are not the active cleanup lifecycle.

Investigation evidence:

- contents_and_purpose: the document defines the active Control Center policy and state, the checker enforces it, and the tests verify it.
- references_and_consumers: `check_control_center.js` loads this document; `tests/edge-control-center-ledger.test.js` and `backend/services/controlCenterReadService.js` consume the checker entrypoint; package scripts expose the control-center checks.
- runtime_use: `node control-center/check_control_center.js` and `node --test tests/edge-control-center-ledger.test.js` are active runtime verification paths.
- dependencies: the gate depends on the asset register, the build ledger, Node `fs`, `path`, and `assert`, plus the state JSON embedded above.
- overlap_or_duplication: the three files are tightly related but not duplicative; they serve distinct policy, gate, and verification roles.

Disposition recorded: USE
Closure status: CLOSED

Active investigation evidence: .bat

- contents_and_purpose: `.bat` is a Windows batch launcher created to start the local SKCS EdgeMind Dolphin/Llama server on port 8080 and open an ngrok tunnel to that local service.
- references_and_consumers: repository search found no code path that invokes `.bat`; governed references are the asset register, asset map, classification batches, and the active Control Center state. Runtime code consumes `DOLPHIN_URL` directly instead of invoking this script.
- runtime_use: no production runtime registration or package script calls `.bat`; if manually executed on the original Windows machine, it opens two command windows for `llama-server.exe` and `ngrok`.
- reads_and_writes: the script reads no repository files and writes no repository files; it starts external processes and binds local/network ports.
- dependencies: depends on Windows `cmd`, `timeout`, a machine-specific `C:\Users\skcsa\models\...` llama-server path, a Dolphin model file, and an installed `ngrok` CLI with a hard-coded tunnel URL.
- overlap_or_duplication: overlaps with `SKCS_START.bat`, which is another root batch launcher for Dolphin and ngrok; backend runtime assets such as `backend/services/aiProvider.js` and `backend/config.js` use `DOLPHIN_URL` rather than either batch file.
- reuse_value: retain the operational idea of a local Dolphin/ngrok launcher, but merge it with the duplicate launcher pattern into one governed, configurable operator script before relying on it.

Disposition recorded: MERGE
Closure status: CLOSED

Active investigation evidence: .dockerignore

- contents_and_purpose: `.dockerignore` is the repository-root Docker context exclusion policy, excluding Node artifacts, local secrets, Python caches/build outputs, OS/IDE files, Git metadata, local vendor folders, script result dumps, and chaos logs from container build context.
- references_and_consumers: Docker tooling consumes `.dockerignore` implicitly when building from the repository root; repository references are the asset register, asset map, classification batches, and current Control Center state.
- runtime_use: it affects container image build inputs, including the root `Dockerfile`; it is not executed at application runtime and has no server route or package-script caller.
- reads_and_writes: the file reads and writes nothing; Docker/build tooling reads it to decide which workspace paths to omit from build context transfer.
- dependencies: depends on Docker build semantics and the root build context; it also relates to local directories/files named in its patterns, including `.env`, `node_modules`, Python cache/build directories, `.git`, IDE folders, `backend/scripts/_vendor`, `backend/scripts/results`, and chaos log files.
- overlap_or_duplication: overlaps substantially with `.gitignore`, but the boundary is different: `.gitignore` governs source control tracking, while `.dockerignore` governs container build context and secret/artifact exclusion.
- reuse_value: keep as an active security and build hygiene configuration; its useful patterns should remain aligned with `.gitignore` and Dockerfile build requirements.

Disposition recorded: KEEP
Closure status: CLOSED

Active investigation evidence: .env.example

- contents_and_purpose: `.env.example` is the repository-root environment template documenting required and optional configuration for application runtime, database access, Supabase, auth, billing, sports providers, AI providers, Render hosts, ingestion limits, pipeline tuning, circuit breakers, and debug flags.
- references_and_consumers: setup docs instruct copying `.env.example` to `.env`; `.gitignore` explicitly keeps `.env.example` tracked while ignoring real env files; runtime code reads matching variables through `process.env`, `dotenv`, and Python `os.getenv`.
- runtime_use: the file itself is not loaded as runtime configuration, but its variable names mirror runtime dependencies used by backend services, scripts, cron triggers, Supabase clients, provider adapters, and deployment config.
- reads_and_writes: `.env.example` reads and writes nothing; developers/operators copy or consult it to create local or deployment environment values.
- dependencies: depends on the current runtime configuration contract across `backend/config.js`, database modules, middleware, provider clients, scripts, `render.yaml`, and docs. It must stay aligned with actual env-variable consumers.
- overlap_or_duplication: overlaps with deployment docs, data-ingestion docs, `.gitignore` env-file policy, and generated external-source inventory references, but it is the central tracked template and not replaced by those assets.
- reuse_value: keep as the canonical non-secret env template; reuse it as the governed source for onboarding and configuration audits, while separately correcting encoding artifacts in a future approved edit if needed.

Disposition recorded: KEEP
Closure status: CLOSED

Closed investigation evidence: .gitignore

- contents_and_purpose: `.gitignore` excludes local env files, dependency directories, build outputs, IDE/OS files, logs, caches, archive output, and local tool state from source control.
- references_and_consumers: Git consumes it directly; the repository governance files also reference the root ignore policy as a tracked configuration artifact. No application runtime code imports it.
- runtime_use: it has no runtime execution role; it only changes what Git tracks.
- reads_and_writes: the file reads and writes nothing.
- dependencies: depends on Git ignore semantics and the repo's local/generated paths such as `.env`, `node_modules`, Python caches, `.vercel`, `_archive/`, `backend/cache/*.json`, and log files.
- overlap_or_duplication: overlaps with `.dockerignore` and `.gcloudignore`, but those files govern different boundaries. The source-control boundary belongs in `.gitignore`.
- reuse_value: keep it as the canonical Git tracking policy for this repository.

Disposition recorded: KEEP
Closure status: CLOSED

Active investigation evidence: .gcloudignore

- contents_and_purpose: `.gcloudignore` is the repository-root Google Cloud CLI upload filter, excluding local secrets, dependency/build directories, IDE files, Git metadata, and large local artifacts from any gcloud-managed source upload.
- references_and_consumers: no application code imports or calls `.gcloudignore`; its direct consumer would be Google Cloud tooling when commands such as deploy or source upload run from the repository root. Current repository references are governance artifacts plus historical documentation traces like `phase2-cleanup.js`, `FULL_WORKSPACE_AUDIT_REPORT.md`, and a comment in `backend/server-express.js` pointing at a now-absent root `docs/google-cloud-soccer-refresh.md`.
- runtime_use: there is no proven current runtime or build path in package scripts, Vercel config, Render config, or live root docs that invokes Google Cloud deployment from this repository. The only Google Cloud operational trail left in-tree is archived or report-derived material, including `_archive/docs_legacy/google-cloud-soccer-refresh.md`; the current tracked root doc is absent.
- reads_and_writes: `.gcloudignore` does not read or write repository files; Google Cloud CLI tooling would read it implicitly to omit matching files from upload context.
- dependencies: depends on Google Cloud CLI ignore semantics and the paths it names, including `.env*`, `node_modules`, Python virtualenv/build outputs, IDE folders, `.git`, `backend/scripts/_vendor`, `backend/scripts/results`, and chaos log files.
- overlap_or_duplication: overlaps heavily with `.gitignore` and materially with `.dockerignore`; most exclusion patterns are already governed elsewhere, and the remaining Google Cloud-specific value only matters if this repository still uses gcloud source-upload workflows.
- reuse_value: retain the useful exclusion patterns, but merge or reconcile them into the surviving ignore-policy surfaces unless a current Google Cloud deployment path is re-established and proved active.

Future phase note: Control Center state persistence/display consistency

- observation: the persisted policy snapshot repeatedly displays `next_deterministic_batch = B01`, while deterministic checker transitions have already accepted B01, B02, and now B03 processing correctly.
- likely_future_work: Control Center state persistence/display consistency

B03 hash re-verification supersession

- previous_b03_evidence_status: superseded
- reason: the earlier B03 hash report failed evidence-integrity review because the reported hashes were not accepted as trustworthy raw PowerShell output.
- verification_method: actual local PowerShell Get-FileHash SHA256 rerun from manifest-derived B03 membership
- manifest_asset_count: 28
- raw_hash_result_count: 28
- count_match: YES
- note: this re-verification records the actual local hash output and supersedes the earlier B03 hash report without erasing the audit trail.

## PHASE 2 - B20 PURPOSE CLASSIFICATION REVIEW - CLOSED

Result: PASS WITH CORRECTION

Scope:
- Batch: B20
- Title: SKCS_KNOWLEDGE_PROVIDERS
- Assets inspected: 18/18
- Start HEAD: 97b821b2

Read-only inspection findings:
- All B20 assets exist.
- All B20 assets are present in the repository asset register.
- All B20 assets are correctly classified as PROVIDER_INTEGRATION.
- Source skim confirms B20 assets are provider audits, endpoint catalogs, health reports, semantic mappings, readiness assessments, call restrictions, and synthesis notes.

Correction:
- SKCS-KNOWLEDGE/providers/soccerdata_provider_health.md purpose_description corrected from NotebookLM/workflow synthesis notes to provider health verification and probe notes.

Out of scope:
- GitHub vulnerability notices were not inspected or changed.

## PHASE 2 - B21 PURPOSE CLASSIFICATION REVIEW - CLOSED

Result: PASS WITH CORRECTION

Scope:
- Batch: B21 / PUBLIC_UI
- Assets reviewed: 64
- Files corrected: 18
- Changed files:
  - control-center/EDGE_REPOSITORY_ASSET_REGISTER.v1.json

Correction:
- public/data/*.json functional_group changed from FRONTEND_UI to GENERATED_OUTPUT.

Reason:
- Source inspection confirmed the public/data JSON files are generated/static sports data and cache outputs, including league data, sports data, event details, team form, injury/news, coverage, and VIP stress data.
- Reference inspection confirmed these files are consumed as data/cache outputs from frontend fetch paths and scripts, not maintained as UI pages/components/styles.
- Existing taxonomy supports GENERATED_OUTPUT for generated JSON/data/report artifacts.

Validation:
- B21 manifest count confirmed: 64.
- B21 post-correction group counts: FRONTEND_UI 38, GENERATED_OUTPUT 18, PUBLIC_ASSET 8.
- Scope limited to B21 purpose classification correction.

## PHASE 2 - B22 PURPOSE CLASSIFICATION REVIEW - CLOSED

Result: PASS - NO CORRECTION

Scope:
- Batch: B22 / SUPABASE_MIGRATIONS
- Manifest declared asset_count: 60
- Actual asset paths reviewed: 61
- Files corrected: 0
- Changed files:
  - control-center/EDGE_CONTROL_CENTER.md

Inspection:
- Confirmed B22 manifest title is SUPABASE_MIGRATIONS.
- Confirmed B22 manifest path list contains 61 actual asset paths under supabase/migrations/, despite declared asset_count being 60.
- Confirmed B22 register entries are classified as DATABASE_MIGRATION.
- Confirmed purpose evidence aligns with Supabase SQL migration files creating or altering database tables, indexes, functions, triggers, views, RLS policies, and related schema objects.

Validation:
- B22 post-inspection group counts: DATABASE_MIGRATION 61.
- No proven B22 purpose classification mismatches found.
- Count discrepancy recorded as a manifest metadata issue for later governance cleanup, not a B22 purpose classification mismatch.
- Scope limited to B22 purpose classification review.

## PHASE 2 - B23 PURPOSE CLASSIFICATION REVIEW - CLOSED

Result: PASS WITH CORRECTION

Scope:
- Batch: B23 / DB_SQL_AND_SUPABASE_OTHER
- Manifest declared asset_count: 20
- Actual asset paths reviewed: 20
- Existing source files found: 19
- Register coverage found: 19/20

Corrections:
- 11 SQL/schema assets changed from DATABASE to DATABASE_MIGRATION after source inspection confirmed schema-changing SQL behaviour.
- supabase/functions/semantic-drift-summary/index.ts changed from SCHEDULER_BACKGROUND to API_ROUTE because it serves HTTP requests, reads URL parameters, invokes get_semantic_violation_summary RPC, and returns JSON.
- control-center/EDGE_ASSET_REPOSITORY_MAP.md regenerated after register correction.

Governance/path drift recorded only:
- supabase/functions/sync-sports-data/index.ts is listed in B23 but is absent from the working tree and absent from the repository asset register.
- No deletion, manifest repair, or path removal was performed in B23.

Changed files:
- control-center/EDGE_REPOSITORY_ASSET_REGISTER.v1.json
- control-center/EDGE_ASSET_REPOSITORY_MAP.md
- control-center/EDGE_CONTROL_CENTER.md

Validation:
- B23 focused validation PASS.
- B23 post-correction counts: DATABASE_MIGRATION 11, DATABASE 4, SCHEDULER_BACKGROUND 3, API_ROUTE 1, REGISTER_MISSING 1.
- Full npm run control:classification remains blocked by pre-existing non-B23 issues: B22 manifest asset_count drift plus invalid relationship tags from earlier B21/B15 corrections.
- Scope limited to B23 purpose classification corrections.

## PHASE 2 - B24 PURPOSE CLASSIFICATION REVIEW - CLOSED

Result: PASS - NO CORRECTION

Scope:
- Batch: B24 / TESTS
- Manifest declared asset_count: 6
- Actual asset paths reviewed: 6
- Register coverage found: 6/6
- Files corrected: 0

Inspection:
- Confirmed B24 manifest title is TESTS.
- Confirmed B24 manifest path list contains 6 test assets under tests/.
- Confirmed all 6 B24 register entries are classified as TEST_PROOF.
- Source evidence scan confirmed each asset is a test or contract-proof file using node:test, assert, checker imports, route/UI checks, register checks, or runtime inventory validation helpers.

Validation:
- B24 post-inspection group counts: TEST_PROOF 6.
- No proven B24 purpose classification mismatches found.
- No register, map, source, manifest, merge, deletion, repair, or refactor was performed.
- Scope limited to B24 purpose classification review.


## PHASE 2 - B25 PURPOSE CLASSIFICATION REVIEW - CLOSED

Result: PASS WITH CORRECTION

Scope:
- Batch: B25 / SCRATCH
- Manifest declared asset_count: 2
- Actual asset paths reviewed: 2
- Register coverage found: 2/2

Correction:
- scratch/db_normalize.js functional_group changed from DATABASE_MIGRATION to DATABASE.
- scratch/db_normalize.js relationship_tags changed from ["DATABASE","MIGRATION","SQL","SCRIPT_TOOL"] to ["DATABASE","SQL","SCRIPT_TOOL"].

Reason:
- Source inspection confirmed scratch/db_normalize.js runs UPDATE statements to normalize sport labels in existing predictions_raw, leagues, and optional match_context_data rows.
- It does not create, alter, drop, index, trigger, function, or policy schema objects.
- Therefore it is database data-maintenance/normalization work, not a database migration.
- scratch/db_sync.js remains DATABASE because it only runs SELECT DISTINCT diagnostics against predictions_raw and leagues.

Changed files:
- control-center/EDGE_REPOSITORY_ASSET_REGISTER.v1.json
- control-center/EDGE_ASSET_REPOSITORY_MAP.md
- control-center/EDGE_CONTROL_CENTER.md

Validation:
- B25 post-correction group counts: DATABASE 2.
- No source, manifest, merge, deletion, retirement, or refactor was performed.
- Scope limited to B25 purpose classification correction.

## PHASE 2 - B26 PURPOSE CLASSIFICATION REVIEW - CLOSED

Result: PASS WITH CORRECTION

Scope:
- Batch: B26 / DEPLOYMENT_CI
- Manifest declared asset_count before correction: 5
- Actual tracked/on-disk asset paths reviewed: 3
- Register coverage found: 3/3
- Map coverage found: 3/3

Correction:
- Removed stale B26 manifest asset_paths:
  - .github/workflows/daily-insights.yml
  - .github/workflows/lineups-insights.yml
- Corrected B26 manifest asset_count from 5 to 3.

Reason:
- Local evidence confirmed both workflow files are not tracked by git.
- Local evidence confirmed both workflow files are missing on disk.
- Local evidence confirmed both workflow files are absent from EDGE_REPOSITORY_ASSET_REGISTER.v1.json.
- Local evidence confirmed both workflow files are absent from EDGE_ASSET_REPOSITORY_MAP.md.
- Therefore B26 manifest membership was stale; this was not missing purpose-classification work.

Inspection:
- Dockerfile remains DEPLOYMENT_OPERATIONS: container build recipe for backend Express server deployment.
- render.yaml remains DEPLOYMENT_OPERATIONS: Render web service and cron/scheduler configuration.
- vercel.json remains DEPLOYMENT_OPERATIONS: Vercel build, function, cron, header, and rewrite configuration.

Changed files:
- control-center/EDGE_ASSET_CLASSIFICATION_BATCHES.v1.json
- control-center/EDGE_CONTROL_CENTER.md

Validation:
- B26 post-correction manifest asset_count: 3.
- B26 post-correction group counts: DEPLOYMENT_OPERATIONS 3.
- No source, register, map, merge, deletion, retirement, or refactor was performed.
- Scope limited to B26 manifest stale-entry correction and purpose classification closure.
## PHASE 2 - B27 PURPOSE CLASSIFICATION REVIEW - CLOSED

Result: PASS WITH CORRECTION

Scope:
- Batch: B27 / ARCHIVE
- Manifest declared asset_count before correction: 59
- Actual manifest asset_paths reviewed: 58
- Map rows reviewed: 58
- Register/map/tracked/disk coverage: PASS

Correction:
- Corrected B27 manifest asset_count from 59 to 58.

Reason:
- Local validation confirmed B27 manifest asset_paths count is 58.
- Local validation confirmed B27 map row count is 58.
- Local validation confirmed all B27 manifest paths are tracked, on disk, in the register, and in the map.
- Therefore the B27 asset_count value was stale; this was not missing archive purpose-classification work.

Inspection:
- All B27 reviewed assets are under _archive/.
- Current state count: STALE_OR_SUPERSEDED 58.
- Functional group counts: DATABASE_MIGRATION 6, GENERATED_OUTPUT 3, SCRIPT_TOOL 49.
- No non-archive rows found.
- No non-stale rows found.

Changed files:
- control-center/EDGE_ASSET_CLASSIFICATION_BATCHES.v1.json
- control-center/EDGE_CONTROL_CENTER.md

Validation:
- B27 post-correction manifest asset_count: 58.
- B27 post-correction purpose classification review result: PASS WITH CORRECTION.
- No source, register, map, merge, deletion, retirement, or refactor was performed.
- Scope limited to B27 manifest asset_count correction and purpose classification closure.
## PHASE 2 - B28 PURPOSE CLASSIFICATION REVIEW - CLOSED

Result: PASS WITH CORRECTION

Scope:
- Batch: B28 / ROOT_NON_MD_TXT_FILES
- Manifest asset_count: 55
- Manifest asset_paths reviewed: 55
- Map rows reviewed: 55
- Register/map/tracked/disk coverage: PASS

Correction:
- Updated kabaddiPy purpose/evidence/next_validation.
- Updated sportbook purpose/evidence/next_validation.
- Functional group remains UNCATEGORIZED because current EAC functional_group enums do not include a dedicated SUBMODULE/GITLINK category.

Reason:
- Local validation confirmed both kabaddiPy and sportbook are Gitlink entries: git ls-tree reports mode 160000 commit.
- Local validation confirmed .gitmodules is missing.
- Local validation confirmed git submodule status fails because no submodule mapping exists.
- Therefore they are orphan Gitlink/submodule pointers, not normal readable folders/files.
- This phase records purpose only; restoration, deletion, retirement, or replacement belongs to later phases.

Inspection:
- B28 manifest count/path count/map row count: 55/55/55.
- B28 coverage: PASS.
- Functional group counts before correction: DATABASE_MIGRATION 1, DEPLOYMENT_OPERATIONS 8, DOCUMENTATION_KNOWLEDGE 1, GENERATED_OUTPUT 16, PUBLIC_ASSET 1, SCRIPT_TOOL 15, TEST_PROOF 11, UNCATEGORIZED 2.
- Current state count: UNKNOWN 55.

Changed files:
- control-center/EDGE_REPOSITORY_ASSET_REGISTER.v1.json
- control-center/EDGE_ASSET_REPOSITORY_MAP.md
- control-center/EDGE_CONTROL_CENTER.md

Validation:
- B28 purpose classification review result: PASS WITH CORRECTION.
- No source, manifest, merge, deletion, retirement, submodule repair, or refactor was performed.
- Scope limited to B28 purpose evidence correction and purpose classification closure.
## PHASE 2 - B28 REGISTER SCOPE REPAIR - CLOSED

Result: PASS

Scope:
- Batch: B28 / ROOT_NON_MD_TXT_FILES
- Repair target: EDGE_REPOSITORY_ASSET_REGISTER.v1.json over-broad text replacement from prior B28 closure commit.
- Intended B28 target assets: kabaddiPy and sportbook only.

Correction:
- Reverted over-broad orphan Gitlink/submodule next_validation, purpose, and evidence text from non-target B28 register entries.
- Preserved the orphan Gitlink/submodule purpose/evidence/next_validation correction only for kabaddiPy and sportbook.
- No map correction was required; the map already had only the two intended B28 row corrections.

Reason:
- Post-push verification showed the B28 register replacement was broader than intended.
- The correct B28 purpose correction applies only to kabaddiPy and sportbook.
- This repair restores Phase 2 scope discipline before B29 starts.

Changed files:
- control-center/EDGE_REPOSITORY_ASSET_REGISTER.v1.json
- control-center/EDGE_CONTROL_CENTER.md

Validation:
- Register orphan Gitlink/submodule purpose count: 2.
- Register orphan Gitlink/submodule evidence count: 2.
- Register orphan Gitlink/submodule next_validation count: 2.
- No source, manifest, map, merge, deletion, retirement, submodule repair, or refactor was performed.
- B29 was not started before this repair.
## PHASE 2 - B29 PURPOSE CLASSIFICATION REVIEW - CLOSED

Result: PASS WITH CORRECTION

Scope:
- Batch: B29 / DOT_TOOL_DIRS_AND_SMALL_DIRS
- Manifest asset_count: 26
- Manifest asset_paths reviewed: 26
- Map rows reviewed: 26
- Register/map/tracked/disk coverage: PASS

Correction:
- Updated .qwen/settings.json from UNCATEGORIZED to DOCUMENTATION_KNOWLEDGE.
- Updated .qwen/settings.json.orig from UNCATEGORIZED to DOCUMENTATION_KNOWLEDGE.
- Updated both Qwen purpose descriptions to identify them as local AI-assistant command-permission settings.

Reason:
- Local validation confirmed both files are readable JSON configuration files.
- Their content defines Qwen allowed Bash command permissions.
- They are not source runtime files, generated outputs, deployments, tests, or executable scripts.
- Therefore DOCUMENTATION_KNOWLEDGE is the closest valid current EAC functional group.

Inspection:
- B29 manifest count/path count/map row count: 26/26/26.
- B29 coverage: PASS.
- Functional group counts before correction: API_ROUTE 1, BACKEND_RUNTIME 2, DEPLOYMENT_OPERATIONS 1, DOCUMENTATION_KNOWLEDGE 9, GENERATED_OUTPUT 8, PROVIDER_INTEGRATION 1, PUBLIC_ASSET 1, SCRIPT_TOOL 1, UNCATEGORIZED 2.
- Current state count: UNKNOWN 26.

Changed files:
- control-center/EDGE_REPOSITORY_ASSET_REGISTER.v1.json
- control-center/EDGE_ASSET_REPOSITORY_MAP.md
- control-center/EDGE_CONTROL_CENTER.md

Validation:
- B29 purpose classification review result: PASS WITH CORRECTION.
- No source, manifest, merge, deletion, retirement, runtime repair, or refactor was performed.
- Scope limited to B29 Qwen purpose classification correction and closure.
## PHASE 2 - B22 MANIFEST COUNT REPAIR - CLOSED

Result: PASS

Scope:
- Batch: B22 / SUPABASE_MIGRATIONS
- Repair target: EDGE_ASSET_CLASSIFICATION_BATCHES.v1.json stale asset_count only.

Correction:
- Corrected B22 manifest asset_count from 60 to 61.

Reason:
- Phase 2 final closure control found B22 asset_count 60 but asset_paths.Count 61.
- Read-only B22 inspection confirmed B22 map row count is 61.
- The first and last manifest paths matched the B22 migration range.
- This was a stale manifest count, not missing purpose-classification work.

Changed files:
- control-center/EDGE_ASSET_CLASSIFICATION_BATCHES.v1.json
- control-center/EDGE_CONTROL_CENTER.md

Validation:
- B22 post-repair asset_count: 61.
- B22 post-repair asset_paths.Count: 61.
- Repository-wide manifest count check: PASS.
- No source, register, map, merge, deletion, retirement, runtime repair, or refactor was performed.
- Scope limited to B22 manifest count correction before Phase 2 closure.
## PHASE 2 - PURPOSE CLASSIFICATION REVIEW - CLOSED

Result: PASS WITH CORRECTIONS

Scope:
- Phase: PHASE_2 / Purpose Classification Review
- Batches reviewed under Phase 2 closure controls: B01-B29
- Final closure control HEAD before closure: 50f80ca1
- Final manifest count check: PASS

Corrections completed during late Phase 2 closure:
- B22 manifest asset_count corrected from 60 to 61.
- B25 scratch database-normalization purpose corrected.
- B26 stale manifest workflow entries removed and asset_count corrected to 3.
- B27 archive manifest asset_count corrected to 58.
- B28 orphan Gitlink/submodule purpose evidence corrected for kabaddiPy and sportbook.
- B28 register scope drift repaired after post-push verification.
- B29 Qwen settings files corrected from UNCATEGORIZED to DOCUMENTATION_KNOWLEDGE.

Final validation:
- Working tree clean before closure.
- Local branch synced with origin/main before closure.
- All batch asset_count values match asset_paths.Count.
- Control Center closure notes exist for late Phase 2 corrections and repairs.
- No source deletion, merge, retirement, runtime repair, submodule repair, or refactor was performed as part of final closure.
- Phase 2 is closed; do not reopen without a new explicit Control Center task.

## CONTROL CENTER PHASE-STATE REPAIR - PHASE 3 ACTIVATED

Result: PASS

Scope:
- Repair target: Control Center cleanup programme machine-readable state and checker alignment.
- Prior completed phases preserved: PHASE_1 Exact Duplicate Elimination, PHASE_2 Purpose Classification Review.
- New active phase: PHASE_3 / Active Use Identification.

- scripts/trigger-pipeline-sync.js
- scripts/trigger-publication.js
- scripts/trigger-refresh.js
- scripts/trigger-settlement.js
- scripts/wake-and-sync.js

Evidence:
- B13 is defined as the SCRIPTS_RUN_TRIGGER_SCHED batch with 20 governed assets.
- B13 manifest rule selects scripts whose basename starts with run- or trigger-, plus exact files: _trigger-sync.js, scheduler.js, external-scheduler.js, wake-and-sync.js, and start-rapidapi-cricket-mcp.js.
- Tracked-reference scan found backend/server-express.js references scripts/run-master-pipeline.js; therefore run-master-pipeline.js is currently active through backend runtime.
- scripts/run-master-pipeline.js invokes scripts/run-stage1-math.js, scripts/run-stage2-context.js, scripts/run-stage3-volatility.js, and scripts/run-edgemind-judge.js; therefore those four scripts are indirectly active through the active pipeline orchestrator.
- package.json exposes scripts/run-migration.js, scripts/run-pipeline-from-context-pack.js, scripts/trigger-grade.js, scripts/trigger-refresh.js, and scripts/trigger-settlement.js as npm operator commands.
- SKCS-KNOWLEDGE scheduled jobs documentation references scripts/external-scheduler.js and scripts/scheduler.js, but no active runtime/process-manager caller was proven in this phase.
- Remaining B13 references found by tracked scan are governance, report, dependency-map, archived-comparison, or operator documentation references.
- No deletion, merge, retirement, dependency/security, or source/runtime/product change is authorized by this evidence.

Validation boundary:
- Evidence only.
- No source/runtime/product files changed.
- No active-use outcome authorizes deletion.
- B13 batch state not advanced in this patch.

- scripts/rebuild-canonical-from-api-sports.js
- scripts/simple-sync.js
- scripts/sync-bsd-enrichment.js
- scripts/sync-ucl-context.js

Evidence:
- B14 is defined as the SCRIPTS_INGEST_ENRICH_SYNC_IMPORT batch with 31 governed assets.
- B14 manifest rule selects scripts whose basename starts with backfill-, bridge-, brute-force, compose-, cricapi-, discover-, enrich-, fetch-, force-enrich-, import-, investigate-, normalize-, publish-, rebuild-, simple-sync, sync-, plus selected exact provider/verification assets.
- Tracked-reference scan found backend/server-express.js references scripts/fetch-live-fixtures.js for full pipeline sync; therefore scripts/fetch-live-fixtures.js is currently active through backend runtime.
- Tracked-reference scan found render.yaml startCommand uses python scripts/populate_sports_data.py; therefore scripts/populate_sports_data.py is currently active through deployment/process configuration.
- package.json exposes operator commands for scripts/backfill-football-context.js, scripts/backfill-prediction-grading.js, scripts/bridge-raw-predictions-for-grading.js, scripts/compose-context-pack.js, scripts/cricapi-cache-refresh.js, scripts/enrich-lineups.js, scripts/enrich-team-form.js, scripts/fetch-thesportsdb-day.js, scripts/sync-bsd-enrichment.js, and scripts/sync-ucl-context.js.
- scripts/backfill-prediction-grading.js invokes scripts/bridge-raw-predictions-for-grading.js, but the parent script is package/operator-driven rather than proven active runtime in this phase.
- Remaining B14 references found by tracked scan are governance, report, dependency-map, audit, documentation, archived-comparison, or operator references.
- No deletion, merge, retirement, dependency/security, or source/runtime/product change is authorized by this evidence.

Validation boundary:
- Evidence only.
- No source/runtime/product files changed.
- No active-use outcome authorizes deletion.
- B14 batch state not advanced in this patch.

- scripts/track-prediction-accuracy.js

Evidence:
- B15 is defined as the SCRIPTS_MAINT_FIX_CLEANUP_MIGRATE batch with 52 governed assets.
- B15 manifest rule selects maintenance/fix/migration script basenames beginning with cleanup-, purge-, quarantine-, repair-, fix-, hotfix-, implement-, complete-phase, and add-, plus selected exact maintenance assets.
- Tracked deployment configuration in render.yaml uses scripts/requirements.txt through `pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt`; therefore scripts/requirements.txt is currently active through deployment/build configuration.
- package.json exposes scripts/build-sportsdb-config.js, scripts/track-prediction-accuracy.js, and scripts/install-local-git-hooks.js as npm operator commands.
- scripts/track-prediction-accuracy.js is an executable grading/accuracy utility with `require.main === module` entrypoint and exported functions, but no active runtime caller was proven in this phase.
- scripts/build-sportsdb-config.js is an executable configuration-generation utility that writes generated sports configuration output, but no active runtime caller was proven in this phase.
- scripts/install-local-git-hooks.js is explicitly local-machine setup tooling and says it is run once per clone through npm run install:hooks.
- Remaining B15 references found by tracked scan are governance, report, dependency-map, archived-comparison, or operator/maintenance references.
- No deletion, merge, retirement, dependency/security, vulnerability, source/runtime/product change is authorized by this evidence.

Validation boundary:
- Evidence only.
- No source/runtime/product files changed.
- No active-use outcome authorizes deletion.
- B15 batch state not advanced in this patch.
- GitHub vulnerability notice remains future dependency/security work and was not touched.

- SUPABASE_TABLES_SUMMARY.md
- TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md

Evidence:
- B16 is defined as the DOCS_ROOT_MD_TXT batch with 36 governed root documentation/text assets.
- B16 manifest rule selects root files with .md and .txt extensions, and the governed B16 asset list also includes root requirements.txt and runtime.txt.
- package.json starts the application through backend/server-express.js and exposes build/test/control/script commands, not B16 root documentation files.
- render.yaml starts the web service with node backend/server-express.js.
- render.yaml uses scripts/requirements.txt for the sports-fixture-population Python cron, not root requirements.txt.
- Root requirements.txt and runtime.txt exist as repository-level Python environment documents, but no active deployment, runtime, package-script, or process-manager caller was proven for them in this phase.
- PRIVACY_POLICY.md and TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md are root policy documents; public delivery uses separate public HTML surfaces, so the root markdown documents are manual/reference assets in this phase.
- AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, DEEPSEEK_STATE.md, DEEPSEEK_SESSION_SKCSTEST.txt, SMB_WINDSURF_FINAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md, and SMB_WINDSURF_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md are operator/AI-assistant guidance or session/reference documents, not proven runtime assets.
- Remaining B16 references found by tracked scan are governance, report, documentation, audit, repository-index, or operator references.
- No deletion, merge, retirement, dependency/security, vulnerability, source/runtime/product change is authorized by this evidence.

Validation boundary:
- Evidence text and UTF-8 preservation repair only.
- No source/runtime/product files changed.
- No active-use outcome authorizes deletion.
- B16 batch state not advanced in this patch.
- GitHub vulnerability notice remains future dependency/security work and was not touched.

Evidence:
- B21 is defined as the PUBLIC_UI batch with 64 governed public UI, static asset, generated public data, frontend script, CSS, image, and route/page files under public/.
- All 64 B21 assets exist in the current working tree.
- backend/server-express.js defines PUBLIC_DIR as the repository public directory and serves it through express.static(PUBLIC_DIR).
- package.json starts the application through node backend/server-express.js.
- render.yaml starts the web service through node backend/server-express.js.
- package.json also builds public/js/supabase-bundle.js and public/css/output.css from tracked frontend sources.
- B21 includes HTML page entrypoints, browser-delivered JavaScript, CSS, images, generated public JSON/data cache files, robots.txt, and subscription/public route files.
- Repository reference inspection found direct UI/runtime/build/governance references across server static delivery, package scripts, render service startup, frontend links/scripts/fetches, Control Center governance files, execution-spine reports, and historical audit records.
- Static public serving proves these files are currently browser-deliverable from the active web service boundary.
- This phase does not determine whether any public route is desirable, current product UX, legacy, duplicated, or safe to retire; those are future phase questions.
- No deletion, merge, retirement, dependency/security, vulnerability, source/runtime/product change is authorized by this evidence.

Validation boundary:
- Evidence only.
- No source/runtime/product files changed.
- No active-use outcome authorizes deletion.
- B21 batch state not advanced in this patch.
- GitHub vulnerability and Dependabot notices remain future dependency/security work and were not touched.

- supabase/migrations/20261007000000_user_experience_feedback.sql

Evidence:
- B22 is defined as the SUPABASE_MIGRATIONS batch with 61 governed SQL migration assets under supabase/migrations/.
- The active application start path is package.json start -> node backend/server-express.js.
- Render web deployment starts node backend/server-express.js and does not execute B22 migrations as part of the web start command.
- Render cron commands in render.yaml do not execute B22 migration files.
- scripts/run-migration.js is a manual migration runner that reads SQL files from supabase/migrations by filename; it also has default migration names from B22.
- package.json exposes db:migrate:rules as a manual command for one B22 migration: 20260820000002_fix_secondary_governance_80_75.sql.
- scripts/apply-migrations.js is a manual migration application script that reads supabase/migrations and filters 20260822 migration files.
- SKCS-KNOWLEDGE/knowledge/database_schema.md treats supabase/migrations/ as schema inventory evidence.
- .githooks/pre-commit includes supabase/migrations/* in the local Master Rulebook guard scope.
- B22 migration files are database schema/change-history assets, not server runtime entrypoints, browser assets, active cron entrypoints, or deployed product code entrypoints.
- This phase does not determine whether any migration has already been applied, should be reapplied, is superseded, is safe to retire, or matches the live Supabase database. Those are future database/schema governance questions.
- No deletion, merge, retirement, dependency/security, vulnerability, source/runtime/product change, schema change, migration execution, or Supabase mutation is authorized by this evidence.

Validation boundary:
- Evidence only.
- No source/runtime/product files changed.
- No active-use outcome authorizes deletion.
- B22 batch state not advanced in this patch.
- GitHub vulnerability and Dependabot notices remain future dependency/security work and were not touched.

## PHASE 3 - B23 ACTIVE USE IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

Result: PASS WITH ABSENT-PATH NOTE

Scope:
- Phase: PHASE_3 - Active Use Identification
- Batch: B23 / DB_SQL_AND_SUPABASE_OTHER
- Question: Is each B23 governed SQL / Supabase non-migration asset currently used?
- Deletion/merge/retirement/refactor performed: NO
- Schema execution performed: NO
- Supabase mutation performed: NO
- Function deployment performed: NO
- Phase 1 reopened: NO
- Phase 2 reopened: NO
- Dependency/security/vulnerability notice work performed: NO

Outcome summary:
- ACTIVE: 0
- INDIRECTLY_ACTIVE: 1
- MANUAL_USE: 18
- NO_CURRENT_USE_FOUND: 1
- UNKNOWN: 0

B23 INDIRECTLY_ACTIVE assets:
- supabase/edge-functions/scheduledFixtureSync/index.ts

B23 MANUAL_USE assets:
- sql/acca_rules.sql
- sql/day_zero_subscription.sql
- sql/extreme_smb_data.sql
- sql/fix_rls_policies.sql
- sql/market_correlations_schema.sql
- sql/master_rulebook_triggers.sql

- supabase/functions/scheduled-prediction-refresh/index.ts
- supabase/functions/semantic-drift-summary/index.ts
- supabase/schema/ai_pipeline_schema.sql

B23 NO_CURRENT_USE_FOUND assets:
- supabase/functions/sync-sports-data/index.ts

Evidence:
- B23 is defined as DB_SQL_AND_SUPABASE_OTHER with 20 governed SQL / Supabase non-migration assets.
- The 14 sql/*.sql files are manual database/schema/admin SQL assets, not active Node runtime imports, browser-delivered assets, Render start commands, or active cron entrypoints.
- sql/tier_rules.sql also has manual audit-tool evidence through scripts/audit-football-rules-alignment.js, which reads sql/tier_rules.sql for drift comparison.
- supabase/edge-functions/scheduledFixtureSync/index.ts is indirectly active because backend/routes/scheduler.js calls ${SUPABASE_URL}/functions/v1/scheduledFixtureSync, and backend/server-express.js mounts schedulerRouter at /api/scheduler.
- supabase/edge-functions/scheduled-fixture-sync/index.ts is manual/external-scheduler related: scripts/run-scheduled-sync.js builds a scheduled-fixture-sync function URL, but no active package start, Render start command, or mounted backend route was found executing that script during app startup.
- supabase/functions/scheduled-prediction-refresh/index.ts is a standalone Supabase function source describing scheduled prediction refresh behavior; no active package start, Render start command, or mounted backend route was found executing it during app startup.
- supabase/functions/semantic-drift-summary/index.ts is a standalone Supabase function source. The active backend semantic drift path is backend/routes/semanticDrift.js -> backend/services/semanticDriftSummaryService.js, mounted by backend/server-express.js at /api/semantic-drift-summary; that active path uses the backend service and database RPC rather than invoking the Supabase function file.
- supabase/functions/sync-sports-data/index.ts is still listed in the B23 manifest but is absent from GitHub main / current tracked source, so no current use can be found for that path in this phase.
- supabase/schema/ai_pipeline_schema.sql is manual schema reference material, not an active runtime entrypoint.
- No deletion, merge, retirement, dependency/security, vulnerability, source/runtime/product change, schema execution, Supabase mutation, or function deployment is authorized by this evidence.
- The absent sync-sports-data manifest/register condition is a future governance cleanup item only; it is not repaired during Phase 3 B23.

Validation boundary:
- Evidence only.
- No source/runtime/product files changed.
- No active-use outcome authorizes deletion.
- B23 batch state not advanced in this patch.
- GitHub vulnerability and Dependabot notices remain future dependency/security work and were not touched.

## PHASE 3 - B24 ACTIVE USE IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

Result: PASS

Scope:
- Phase: PHASE_3 - Active Use Identification
- Batch: B24 / TESTS
- Question: Is each B24 governed test file currently used?
- Deletion/merge/retirement/refactor performed: NO
- Test rewrite performed: NO
- Runtime/product change performed: NO
- Phase 1 reopened: NO
- Phase 2 reopened: NO
- Dependency/security/vulnerability notice work performed: NO

Outcome summary:
- ACTIVE: 0
- INDIRECTLY_ACTIVE: 0
- MANUAL_USE: 6
- NO_CURRENT_USE_FOUND: 0
- UNKNOWN: 0

B24 MANUAL_USE assets:
- tests/edge-asset-classification.test.js
- tests/edge-control-center-ledger.test.js
- tests/edge-control-center-ui.test.js
- tests/edge-project-register.test.js
- tests/edge-repository-asset-register.test.js
- tests/edge-system-runtime-inventory.test.js

Evidence:
- B24 is defined as the TESTS batch with 6 governed test files under tests/.
- package.json exposes test:asset-classification for tests/edge-asset-classification.test.js.
- package.json exposes test:control-center for tests/edge-control-center-ledger.test.js, tests/edge-project-register.test.js, and tests/edge-repository-asset-register.test.js.
- package.json exposes test:control-center-ui for tests/edge-control-center-ui.test.js.
- tests/edge-system-runtime-inventory.test.js is a manual Node test file using node:test and importing control-center/check_edge_system_runtime_inventory.js.
- package.json control:verify runs the control-center validation suite, but does not make these test files runtime entrypoints for the deployed product.
- B24 files are validation/test assets, not active server startup files, browser-delivered assets, Render start commands, cron commands, schema execution files, or Supabase mutation files.
- No deletion, merge, retirement, dependency/security, vulnerability, test rewrite, source/runtime/product change, or test-suite restructuring is authorized by this evidence.

Validation boundary:
- Evidence only.
- No source/runtime/product files changed.
- No active-use outcome authorizes deletion.
- B24 batch state not advanced in this patch.
- GitHub vulnerability and Dependabot notices remain future dependency/security work and were not touched.

## PHASE 3 - B25 ACTIVE USE IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

Result: PASS

Scope:
- Phase: PHASE_3 - Active Use Identification
- Batch: B25 / SCRATCH
- Question: Is each B25 governed scratch file currently used?
- Deletion/merge/retirement/refactor performed: NO
- Script execution performed: NO
- Database mutation performed: NO
- Runtime/product change performed: NO
- Phase 1 reopened: NO
- Phase 2 reopened: NO
- Dependency/security/vulnerability notice work performed: NO

Outcome summary:
- ACTIVE: 0
- INDIRECTLY_ACTIVE: 0
- MANUAL_USE: 2
- NO_CURRENT_USE_FOUND: 0
- UNKNOWN: 0

B25 MANUAL_USE assets:
- scratch/db_normalize.js
- scratch/db_sync.js

Evidence:
- B25 is defined as the SCRATCH batch with 2 governed scratch files: scratch/db_normalize.js and scratch/db_sync.js.
- scratch/db_normalize.js is a manual database normalization utility. It imports backend/database and performs UPDATE statements against predictions_raw, leagues, and match_context_data.
- scratch/db_sync.js is a manual database inspection utility. It imports backend/database and reads distinct sport values from predictions_raw and leagues.
- package.json active app startup is node backend/server-express.js; B25 scratch files are not active startup entrypoints.
- No package.json npm script was found that runs scratch/db_normalize.js or scratch/db_sync.js.
- B25 files are manual/admin scratch utilities, not deployed product runtime entrypoints, browser-delivered assets, Render start commands, cron commands, schema migration files, or Supabase function deployment files.
- Because scratch/db_normalize.js can mutate database rows, this phase does not execute either B25 file.
- No deletion, merge, retirement, dependency/security, vulnerability, source/runtime/product change, database mutation, or scratch cleanup is authorized by this evidence.

Validation boundary:
- Evidence only.
- No source/runtime/product files changed.
- No active-use outcome authorizes deletion.
- B25 batch state not advanced in this patch.
- GitHub vulnerability and Dependabot notices remain future dependency/security work and were not touched.

## PHASE 3 - B26 ACTIVE USE IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

Result: PASS

Scope:
- Phase: PHASE_3 - Active Use Identification
- Batch: B26 / DEPLOYMENT_CI
- Question: Is each B26 governed deployment/CI asset currently used?
- Deletion/merge/retirement/refactor performed: NO
- Deployment config change performed: NO
- Render change performed: NO
- Vercel change performed: NO
- Docker build performed: NO
- Runtime/product change performed: NO
- Phase 1 reopened: NO
- Phase 2 reopened: NO
- Dependency/security/vulnerability notice work performed: NO

Outcome summary:
- ACTIVE: 2
- INDIRECTLY_ACTIVE: 0
- MANUAL_USE: 1
- NO_CURRENT_USE_FOUND: 0
- UNKNOWN: 0

B26 ACTIVE assets:
- render.yaml
- vercel.json

B26 MANUAL_USE assets:
- Dockerfile

Evidence:
- B26 is defined as DEPLOYMENT_CI with 3 governed assets: Dockerfile, render.yaml, and vercel.json.
- render.yaml is active deployment configuration evidence. It defines the Render web service, Node environment, buildCommand, startCommand, healthCheckPath, autoDeploy setting, environment variables, and cron services.
- render.yaml starts the active web app with node backend/server-express.js and defines Render cron start commands for deploy-trigger jobs and fixture population.
- vercel.json is active deployment configuration evidence. It defines Vercel version/framework behavior, installCommand, buildCommand, outputDirectory, function duration config, headers, cron path, and rewrites.
- Dockerfile is container deployment material. It defines a Node 20 Alpine image, installs production dependencies, exposes PORT 8080, and starts node backend/server-express.js.
- Current repo deployment evidence does not show Render using Dockerfile: render.yaml declares env: node and startCommand: node backend/server-express.js.
- Dockerfile is therefore treated as MANUAL_USE / deployment-capable material in this phase, not as an active deployment entrypoint.
- No deletion, merge, retirement, dependency/security, vulnerability, deployment config change, Render change, Vercel change, Docker build, source/runtime/product change, or deployment cleanup is authorized by this evidence.

Validation boundary:
- Evidence only.
- No source/runtime/product files changed.
- No deployment configuration files changed.
- No active-use outcome authorizes deletion.
- B26 batch state not advanced in this patch.
- GitHub vulnerability and Dependabot notices remain future dependency/security work and were not touched.

## PHASE 3 - B27 ACTIVE USE IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

Result: PASS

Scope:
- Phase: PHASE_3 - Active Use Identification
- Batch: B27 / ARCHIVE
- Question: Is each B27 governed archived asset currently used?
- Deletion/merge/retirement/refactor performed: NO
- Restore performed: NO
- Archived script execution performed: NO
- Database mutation performed: NO
- Deployment change performed: NO
- Runtime/product change performed: NO
- Phase 1 reopened: NO
- Phase 2 reopened: NO
- Dependency/security/vulnerability notice work performed: NO

Evidence:
- B27 is defined as the ARCHIVE batch with 58 governed paths under _archive/.
- B27 assets include archived root artifacts, archived JavaScript utilities, archived shell scripts, archived SQL files, archived reports, and old trigger/verification utilities.
- package.json active app startup is node backend/server-express.js; B27 archive files are not package startup entrypoints.
- render.yaml active web startup is node backend/server-express.js; B27 archive files are not Render web start commands.
- Repository search evidence found _archive/ references in governance/audit files rather than active startup surfaces.
- B27 assets are treated as manual archive / historical reference material in this phase, not active runtime assets.
- Some B27 files appear to be old patch, migration, cleanup, wipe, deployment, and verification utilities. This phase does not execute any archived script or SQL file.
- No deletion, merge, retirement, dependency/security, vulnerability, restore, source/runtime/product change, database mutation, deployment change, archive cleanup, or historical-evidence cleanup is authorized by this evidence.

Validation boundary:
- Evidence only.
- No source/runtime/product files changed.
- No archived file executed.
- No active-use outcome authorizes deletion.
- B27 batch state not advanced in this patch.
- GitHub vulnerability and Dependabot notices remain future dependency/security work and were not touched.

- B01 title: CONTROL_CENTER
- B01 asset_count: 15
- All 15 B01 asset paths exist locally.
- All 15 B01 asset paths are tracked by Git.

B01 outcome summary:
- CURRENT: 15
- LEGACY: 0
- SUPERSEDED: 0
- REPLACED_BY: 0
- PARALLEL: 0
- HISTORICAL_EVIDENCE: 0
- UNKNOWN: 0

B01 CURRENT assets:
1. control-center/check_control_center.js
2. control-center/check_edge_asset_classification.js
3. control-center/check_edge_project_register.js
4. control-center/check_edge_repository_asset_register.js
5. control-center/check_edge_system_runtime_inventory.js
6. control-center/EDGE_ASSET_CLASSIFICATION_BATCHES.v1.json

14. control-center/EDGE_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_INVENTORY.v1.json
15. control-center/EDGE_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_MAP.md

Evidence:
- package.json exposes active Control Center scripts for control:center, control:projects, control:assets, control:classification, control:classification:closure, and control:runtime.
- tests reference the B01 Control Center checkers and canonical governance artifacts.
- EDGE_ASSET_CLASSIFICATION_BATCHES.v1.json declares B01 membership and governed asset source.
- EDGE_ASSET_REPOSITORY_MAP.md and EDGE_REPOSITORY_ASSET_REGISTER.v1.json describe the B01 assets as governance, checker, generated output, documentation, runtime inventory, and repository asset authority surfaces.
- EDGE_PROJECT_BACKLOG.md and EDGE_PROJECT_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md are generated from EDGE_MASTER_PROJECT_REGISTER.v1.json but remain current governed documentation outputs.
- EDGE_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_MAP.md is synchronized from EDGE_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_INVENTORY.v1.json but remains a current governed runtime review output.
- Search terms found legacy/replacement vocabulary inside checker logic and governance policy text, but did not prove any B01 asset itself has been replaced, superseded, deprecated, obsolete, or archived.

Decision:
- All 15 B01 Control Center assets remain CURRENT for Phase 4.
- Generated or derived status does not make a B01 asset legacy when the source/checker relationship remains current and governed.
- No B01 replacement, supersession, parallel successor, or historical-only status is proven.

Validation boundary:
- Evidence only.
- No cleanup action is authorized by this B01 outcome.
- B01 Phase 4 evidence is closed.
- Next batch: B02 - BACKEND_DIRECT_FILES.

- Database/Supabase mutation performed: NO
- Dependency/security/vulnerability remediation performed: NO

B02 manifest evidence:
- B02 batch_id: B02
- B02 title: BACKEND_DIRECT_FILES
- B02 asset_count: 13
- All 13 B02 asset paths exist locally.
- All 13 B02 asset paths are tracked by Git.

B02 outcome summary:
- CURRENT: 12
- LEGACY: 0
- SUPERSEDED: 1
- REPLACED_BY: 0
- PARALLEL: 0
- HISTORICAL_EVIDENCE: 0
- UNKNOWN: 0

B02 CURRENT assets:
1. backend/.gitignore
2. backend/apiClients.js
3. backend/checkCanonicalEvents.js
4. backend/config.js
5. backend/database.js
6. backend/db.js
7. backend/dbBootstrap.js
8. backend/deploy-trigger-cricket.js
9. backend/deploy-trigger.js
10. backend/edgemind_inference.py
11. backend/server-express.js
12. backend/test-ultra-slim.js

B02 SUPERSEDED assets:
1. backend/package-lock.json

Evidence:
- package.json starts the application through node backend/server-express.js.
- render.yaml starts backend/server-express.js, backend/deploy-trigger.js, and backend/deploy-trigger-cricket.js.
- AGENTS.md identifies backend/apiClients.js, backend/dbBootstrap.js, backend/db.js, backend/config.js, and backend/server-express.js as current backend architecture/runtime assets.
- backend/checkCanonicalEvents.js is a tracked manual Supabase canonical_events audit script. No replacement or superseding audit script was proven in this phase.
- backend/edgemind_inference.py is a tracked standalone EdgeMind/Antigravity inference bridge with a CLI entrypoint. No active Node/server caller was proven, but no replacement or superseding bridge was proven either.
- backend/test-ultra-slim.js is a tracked manual EdgeMind/Dolphin ultra-slim inference test harness. No replacement or superseding test harness was proven in this phase.
- backend/package-lock.json is a minimal backend lockfile with only an empty backend package entry.
- backend/package.json does not exist.
- root package.json exists and governs active start/build scripts.
- Therefore backend/package-lock.json is superseded as a backend dependency authority, but this Phase 4 outcome does not authorize deletion.

Decision:
- Twelve B02 backend direct files remain CURRENT for Phase 4.
- backend/package-lock.json is SUPERSEDED because its paired backend/package.json is absent and active dependency/startup authority is at the repository root.
- No B02 deletion, merge, retirement, refactor, source change, SQL execution, deployment change, database/Supabase mutation, dependency update, or vulnerability remediation is authorized.

Validation boundary:
- Evidence only.
- No cleanup action is authorized by this B02 outcome.
- B02 Phase 4 evidence is closed.
- Next batch: B03 - BACKEND_ROUTES_AND_CONTROLLERS.

1. backend/src/services/contextIntelligence/cacheService.js
2. backend/src/services/marketRouter/waterfall.js

B07 CURRENT assets:
- All remaining 7 B07 assets are CURRENT.
- Evidence: B07 attention scan found the two listed files had no direct consumers and previous NO_CURRENT_USE_FOUND status. Remaining B07 assets retained active/manual current evidence from the compact scan.

B08 LEGACY assets:
1. backend/adapters/f1Adapter.js

B08 CURRENT assets:
- All remaining 12 B08 assets are CURRENT.
- Evidence: backend/adapters/f1Adapter.js explicitly throws "F1 adapter is disabled in this deployment" and had no direct consumers.
- backend/config/subscriptionMatrix.js is CURRENT because it is referenced by AGENTS.md, backend/controllers/edgeMindController.js, backend/routes/debug.js, backend/routes/predictions.js, backend/routes/vip.js, backend/server-express.js, and migration planning scripts.

Evidence:
- B11 check/validate/verify scripts are retained as CURRENT manual verification and governance-support tools. No replacement or superseding checker was proven in this phase.
- B12 test/debug/diagnostic/trace scripts are retained as CURRENT manual diagnostic and test tools. No replacement or superseding diagnostic/test harness was proven in this phase.
- B13 run/trigger/scheduler scripts are retained as CURRENT manual/operator trigger tools. No replacement or superseding trigger path was proven in this phase.
- B14 ingest/enrich/sync/import/backfill scripts are retained as CURRENT manual/operator data movement and inspection tools. No replacement or superseding ingest/enrichment/import tool was proven in this phase.

B19 strong marker disposition:
- SKCS-KNOWLEDGE/knowledge/provider_registry.md remains CURRENT. The "superseded by" marker refers to Bzzoiro provider evaluation being superseded by BBD focus, not replacement of the provider registry file.
- SKCS-KNOWLEDGE/knowledge/semantic_field_mapping_registry.md remains CURRENT. The "do not use" markers are anti-pattern and truth-layer boundary rules inside the registry, not instructions that the registry file is unused or replaced.

B21 strong marker disposition:
- public/js/supabase-bundle.js remains CURRENT. The "deprecated" markers are inside bundled Supabase library comments and warnings for specific API options/methods, not evidence that the bundle asset itself is replaced.
- public/terms.html remains CURRENT. The "do not use" marker is user-facing legal Terms wording, not an instruction that the file is unused or replaced.

B22 strong marker disposition:
- supabase/migrations/20260531000002_skcs_engine_v2_phase0b_match_results.sql remains CURRENT as a migration record. The "deprecated" marker refers to one SQL function path inside the migration, while the migration also defines the match_results spine and canonical ingest path.
- supabase/migrations/20261006000000_sportsdataio_contract_alignment.sql remains CURRENT as a migration record. The "deprecated" and "retired" markers are allowed values inside a data_contracts status CHECK constraint, not evidence that the migration file is deprecated or retired.

- B24 strong legacy/replacement markers: 1.
- B25 strong legacy/replacement markers: 0.
- B26 strong legacy/replacement markers: 0.

B23 missing path disposition:
- supabase/functions/sync-sports-data/index.ts is absent from the working tree.
- Git history shows it was deleted in commit d869061e, subject "Retire unused Supabase pipeline trigger".
- Deletion evidence: delete mode 100644 supabase/functions/sync-sports-data/index.ts.
- Existing Control Center notes already record that the B23 manifest still lists the path while current tracked source does not, and that this remains future governance cleanup only.
- Phase 4 therefore treats this absent path as HISTORICAL_EVIDENCE / already-retired evidence, not CURRENT and not UNKNOWN.
- No deletion or governance cleanup is authorized by Phase 4.

B24 strong marker disposition:
- tests/edge-control-center-ledger.test.js remains CURRENT.
- The "retired" marker appears inside an assertion that legacy per-asset forensic modes are retired.
- The marker does not describe the test file itself as retired.
- The file is actively referenced by package.json test:control-center and governance/control-center references.

Attention-only scan:
- B27 strong legacy/replacement markers: 1.
- B28 strong legacy/replacement markers: 1.
- B29 strong legacy/replacement markers: 0.

B27 archive disposition:
- B27 is explicitly titled ARCHIVE.
- B27 manifest authority uses prefix rule _archive/.
- All B27 assets are under _archive/ and are retained as historical/archive evidence, not current operational source.
- _archive/scripts/analyze-table-usage.js contains a "DEPRECATED (no code, no data)" category inside the script output logic; this describes table classification inside the script, not an additional file-level replacement marker.
- Phase 4 therefore treats B27 as HISTORICAL_EVIDENCE.
- No deletion or cleanup action is authorized by this outcome.

B28 strong marker disposition:
- package-lock.json remains CURRENT.
- The "deprecated" marker appears inside the dependency graph for node_modules/prebuild-install, not as a marker that package-lock.json itself is deprecated.
- Root package.json is active and package-lock.json remains the root dependency lockfile for the active root package authority.
- The previously identified backend/package-lock.json supersession does not apply to the root package-lock.json.

B29 disposition:
- B29 has no strong legacy/replacement markers.
- Dot-tool, hook, JS config/source, small data, and local tool directory assets remain CURRENT for Phase 4 purposes unless later phases prove cleanup, merge, retirement, or deletion.

## PHASE 5 - B01 FUNCTIONAL OVERLAP IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

Result: PASS

Scope:
- Phase: PHASE_5 - Functional Overlap Identification
- Batch: B01 - CONTROL_CENTER
- Evidence type: functional-overlap identification only
- Deletion/merge/retirement/refactor performed: NO
- Source/runtime/product change performed: NO
- SQL execution performed: NO
- Deployment change performed: NO
- Database/Supabase mutation performed: NO
- Dependency/security/vulnerability remediation performed: NO

B01 manifest evidence:
- B01 batch_id: B01
- B01 title: CONTROL_CENTER
- B01 asset_count: 15
- Start HEAD: 82f32e2f
- All 15 B01 asset paths were inspected by compact reference scan.

B01 outcome summary:
- NO_OVERLAP: 0
- PARTIAL_OVERLAP: 15
- MAJOR_OVERLAP: 0
- POTENTIAL_MERGE_GROUP: 0

Functional-overlap groups:

1. Core Control Center governance group:
- control-center/EDGE_BUILD_CONTROL_LEDGER.v1.json
- control-center/EDGE_CONTROL_CENTER.md
- control-center/check_control_center.js

Outcome:
- PARTIAL_OVERLAP

Evidence:
- EDGE_BUILD_CONTROL_LEDGER.v1.json is the machine ledger for tasks, statuses, proof requirements, gates, and sequencing.
- EDGE_CONTROL_CENTER.md is the operator-facing governance document and structured state surface.
- check_control_center.js validates the ledger and Control Center state.
- These files intentionally overlap on Control Center governance concepts but do not perform the same job.

Decision:
- Keep separate.
- No merge group is proven.

2. Asset classification and repository asset authority group:
- control-center/check_edge_asset_classification.js
- control-center/EDGE_ASSET_CLASSIFICATION_BATCHES.v1.json
- control-center/EDGE_REPOSITORY_ASSET_REGISTER.v1.json
- control-center/EDGE_ASSET_REPOSITORY_MAP.md

Outcome:
- PARTIAL_OVERLAP

Evidence:
- EDGE_ASSET_CLASSIFICATION_BATCHES.v1.json defines deterministic B01-B29 batch membership.
- EDGE_REPOSITORY_ASSET_REGISTER.v1.json is the governed asset register.
- check_edge_asset_classification.js validates classification and can render EDGE_ASSET_REPOSITORY_MAP.md.
- EDGE_ASSET_REPOSITORY_MAP.md is the human-readable generated repository map.
- These files overlap because they describe the same governed asset universe from different control surfaces.

Decision:
- Keep separate.
- Generated-map overlap is expected and does not prove a merge candidate.

3. Project register projection group:
- control-center/check_edge_project_register.js
- control-center/EDGE_MASTER_PROJECT_REGISTER.v1.json
- control-center/EDGE_PROJECT_BACKLOG.md
- control-center/EDGE_PROJECT_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md

Outcome:
- PARTIAL_OVERLAP

Evidence:
- EDGE_MASTER_PROJECT_REGISTER.v1.json is the project register authority derived from the ledger.
- EDGE_PROJECT_BACKLOG.md is generated from EDGE_MASTER_PROJECT_REGISTER.v1.json.
- EDGE_PROJECT_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md is generated from EDGE_MASTER_PROJECT_REGISTER.v1.json.
- check_edge_project_register.js validates and synchronizes the project register projections.
- These files overlap because backlog and dependency documentation are projections of the master register.

Decision:
- Keep separate.
- Projection overlap is expected and does not prove a merge candidate.

4. Runtime inventory projection group:
- control-center/check_edge_system_runtime_inventory.js
- control-center/EDGE_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_INVENTORY.v1.json
- control-center/EDGE_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_MAP.md

Outcome:
- PARTIAL_OVERLAP

Evidence:
- EDGE_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_INVENTORY.v1.json is the machine-readable runtime inventory.
- EDGE_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_MAP.md is the synchronized human-readable runtime review surface.
- check_edge_system_runtime_inventory.js validates the runtime inventory and synchronizes the runtime map.
- These files overlap because the runtime map reflects the runtime inventory.

Decision:
- Keep separate.
- Runtime inventory projection overlap is expected and does not prove a merge candidate.

Batch decision:
- B01 has controlled PARTIAL_OVERLAP across governance source/checker/projection surfaces.
- No MAJOR_OVERLAP is proven.
- No POTENTIAL_MERGE_GROUP is proven.
- No cleanup action is authorized by this outcome.
- B01 Phase 5 evidence is closed.
- Next batch: B02 - BACKEND_DIRECT_FILES.

Validation boundary:
- Evidence only.
- No deletion, merge, retirement, refactor, source/runtime/product change, SQL execution, deployment change, database/Supabase mutation, dependency update, or vulnerability remediation is authorized.

## PHASE 5 - B02-B03 FUNCTIONAL OVERLAP IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE

Result: PASS WITH OVERLAP CANDIDATES

Scope:
- Phase: PHASE_5 - Functional Overlap Identification
- Batches: B02 - BACKEND_DIRECT_FILES; B03 - BACKEND_ROUTES_AND_CONTROLLERS

Batch manifest evidence:
- B02 asset_count: 13
- B03 asset_count: 28
- Combined reviewed assets: 41
- Start HEAD: a5999ceb
- Compact overlap scan inspected B02-B03 membership, route mounting, database exports, prediction route endpoints, and cricket route endpoints.

Outcome vocabulary used:
- NO_OVERLAP
- PARTIAL_OVERLAP
- MAJOR_OVERLAP
- POTENTIAL_MERGE_GROUP

Candidate group 1: database access authority

Assets:
- backend/database.js
- backend/db.js
- backend/dbBootstrap.js

Outcome:
- POTENTIAL_MERGE_GROUP

Evidence:
- backend/database.js creates a PostgreSQL pool, auto-converts Supabase direct URLs to pooler URLs, exposes query/transaction helpers, initializes tables, and exports broad database functions including getPredictionsByTier and getProfileById.
- backend/db.js also creates a PostgreSQL pool, auto-converts Supabase direct URLs to pooler URLs, and exports pool/query/withTransaction.
- backend/dbBootstrap.js also performs database compatibility/bootstrap work for prediction final tables and views.
- Multiple B03 routes consume either ../db or ../database, proving more than one database access surface remains active.

Decision:
- Functional overlap is proven.
- No canonical database access authority is selected in Phase 5.
- No merge, deletion, or refactor is authorized.
- Carry forward as a potential future merge/canonicalization group.

Candidate group 2: server inline endpoint versus route-module boundary

Assets:
- backend/server-express.js
- backend/routes/pipeline.js
- backend/routes/predictions.js
- backend/routes/debug.js
- backend/routes/scheduler.js
- backend/routes/cricketCron.js
- backend/routes/cricketInsights.js
- backend/routes/cricketCount.js
- backend/routes/sportsEdge.js
- backend/routes/v1/predictions.js

Outcome:
- POTENTIAL_MERGE_GROUP

Evidence:
- backend/server-express.js imports and mounts B03 route modules including predictions, pipeline, debug, user, chat, accuracy, vip, direct1x2, cricketInsights, cricketCount, cricketCron, scheduler, metrics, semanticDrift, divanscore, antigravity, controlCenter, and v1 routes.
- The same server file also still contains inline endpoint definitions for pipeline trigger, refresh-predictions scheduler paths, debug sync/test paths, cricket daily fixtures cron, master pipeline cron, AI predictions lookup, and cricket table health checks.
- This proves overlap between the main server bootstrap file and modular route files, especially for pipeline, prediction, scheduler, debug, and cricket responsibilities.

Decision:
- Functional overlap is proven.
- The current file arrangement may be intentional or legacy-mixed; Phase 5 does not decide replacement.
- No endpoint move, router extraction, deletion, or refactor is authorized.
- Carry forward as a future route-boundary/canonicalization candidate.

Candidate group 3: prediction delivery and prediction API surfaces

Assets:
- backend/routes/predictions.js
- backend/routes/v1/predictions.js
- backend/routes/user.js
- backend/routes/vip.js
- backend/routes/direct1x2.js
- backend/routes/v1/acca.js
- backend/routes/v1/sameMatchBuilder.js
- backend/routes/v1/secondaryMarkets.js
- backend/server-express.js

Outcome:
- MAJOR_OVERLAP

Evidence:
- backend/routes/predictions.js exposes the main predictions API and reads direct1x2_prediction_final.
- backend/routes/v1/predictions.js exposes v1 match prediction, batch, and history endpoints and also reads direct1x2_prediction_final and secondary_market_predictions.
- backend/routes/user.js exposes subscription-gated user prediction access.
- backend/routes/vip.js exposes VIP/stress prediction payload access and reads direct1x2_prediction_final.
- backend/routes/direct1x2.js, v1/acca.js, v1/sameMatchBuilder.js, and v1/secondaryMarkets.js are related prediction/market/ACCA API surfaces.
- backend/server-express.js also contains an inline /api/ai-predictions/:matchId endpoint that falls back through prediction tables.

Decision:
- Major functional overlap is proven across prediction delivery surfaces.
- Different audiences and API contracts may justify separation, so a merge group is not selected yet.
- No route removal, API consolidation, refactor, or behavior change is authorized.
- Carry forward as a future API-boundary review candidate.

Candidate group 4: cricket count, cache, cron, and insight surfaces

Assets:
- backend/routes/cricketCache.js
- backend/routes/cricketCount.js
- backend/routes/cricketCron.js
- backend/routes/cricketInsights.js
- backend/deploy-trigger-cricket.js
- backend/server-express.js

Outcome:
- POTENTIAL_MERGE_GROUP

Evidence:
- backend/routes/cricketCache.js reads CricAPI cache.
- backend/routes/cricketCron.js builds/refreshes Cricbuzz and CricAPI cricket data through cron routes.
- backend/deploy-trigger-cricket.js triggers a cricket cron URL.
- backend/routes/cricketCount.js exposes a cricket count endpoint from cricket_insights_final.
- backend/routes/cricketInsights.js also defines a lightweight /count endpoint and an insights endpoint that counts and groups cricket insight rows.
- backend/server-express.js separately contains an inline cricket daily fixtures cron endpoint and an inline cricket table health/debug endpoint.

Decision:
- Functional overlap is proven, especially between cricketCount.js and cricketInsights.js count behavior, and between cricketCron.js and server-express.js inline cricket cron behavior.
- No consolidation or removal is authorized.
- Carry forward as a future cricket route-boundary/canonicalization candidate.

Candidate group 5: deploy trigger files and called route endpoints

Assets:
- backend/deploy-trigger.js
- backend/routes/pipeline.js
- backend/deploy-trigger-cricket.js
- backend/routes/cricketCron.js
- backend/server-express.js

Outcome:
- PARTIAL_OVERLAP

Evidence:
- backend/deploy-trigger.js calls /api/pipeline/run-full.
- backend/routes/pipeline.js owns pipeline route behavior.
- backend/deploy-trigger-cricket.js calls /api/cron/cricket-daily-fixtures.
- backend/routes/cricketCron.js owns cricket cron route behavior, while backend/server-express.js also contains an inline cricket daily fixtures endpoint.
- Trigger files and route files touch the same workflows but have different roles: caller/launcher versus HTTP route owner.

Decision:
- Partial functional overlap is proven.
- Keep separate for now.
- No deletion, merge, or refactor is authorized.

Distinct-role findings:
- backend/.gitignore: backend source-control ignore boundary; no B02-B03 functional overlap proven.
- backend/apiClients.js: provider/client and quota/circuit-breaker access surface; no same-job route/controller file proven in this batch.
- backend/checkCanonicalEvents.js: manual Supabase canonical_events audit script; no same-job B02-B03 asset proven.
- backend/config.js: environment/config authority; no same-job B02-B03 asset proven.
- backend/edgemind_inference.py and backend/test-ultra-slim.js: EdgeMind/manual inference bridge and test harness; related to EdgeMind work but no same-job B02-B03 merge group proven.
- backend/controllers/edgeMindController.js and backend/routes/chat.js: controller/route relationship; dependency relationship does not itself prove functional overlap.
- backend/routes/accuracy.js and backend/routes/skcsGrading.js: both relate to grading/accuracy reporting but current evidence proves related reporting surfaces, not a merge group.
- backend/routes/antigravity.js, controlCenter.js, divanscore.js, feedback.js, metrics.js, refresh-ai.js, semanticDrift.js, sportsEdge.js, and tier1.js: no same-job B02-B03 merge group proven by this scan.

Batch decision:
- B02-B03 contains proven functional overlap candidates.
- Potential future merge/canonicalization candidates are recorded for database access, server route boundary, cricket route boundary, and prediction API boundary.
- No cleanup action is authorized by this outcome.
- B02-B03 Phase 5 evidence is closed.
- Next batch group: B04-B06.

Validation boundary:
- Evidence only.
- No deletion, merge, retirement, refactor, source/runtime/product change, SQL execution, deployment change, database/Supabase mutation, dependency update, or vulnerability remediation is authorized.

Evidence:
- backend/core/verificationController.js is a core verification controller and uses database query access plus verification signal contracts.
- backend/semantic-layer/verificationController.js imports the core verification controller and adapts semantic-layer context into verification signals.
- backend/core/verificationSignalContract.js defines verification signal types.
- backend/core/executionPipeline.js consumes semantic-layer verification, preflight, gatekeeper, control-plane, fingerprint, and error-memory components.
- These files overlap around verification and pipeline health concepts, but the current evidence shows layered roles rather than identical jobs.

Decision:
- Keep separate for now.
- No merge group is selected in Phase 5.
- Carry forward only as a boundary-review candidate.

Candidate group 2: semantic governance and control-plane pipeline

Assets:

- backend/core/executionPipeline.js orchestrates the semantic-layer components.
- controlPlaneEvaluator, preflightSimulator, gatekeeperAdapter, governanceGatekeeper, normalizer, registry, and violationLogger each appear to handle separate parts of the pipeline-control chain.
- The evidence proves related layered control-plane responsibilities, not a single same-job implementation.

Decision:
- Keep separate.
- No merge, refactor, or consolidation is authorized.
- Carry forward as a semantic boundary review area only.

Candidate group 3: ACCA, market consistency, and insight-rule surfaces

Assets:

Outcome:
- POTENTIAL_MERGE_GROUP

Evidence:
- ACCA, market validation, market diversity, market consistency, conflict detection, and secondary-market selection logic appears across multiple utility files.
- backend/utils/insightEngine.js describes itself as SKCS ACCA core law and references the pipeline insightEngine -> accaLogicEngine -> accaBuilder -> routes -> client.
- backend/utils/accaLogicEngine.js contains ACCA math and leg-selection utilities.
- backend/utils/insightValidationMatrix.js validates insight leg groups.
- backend/utils/marketConsistency.js and backend/utils/conflictResolver.js both relate to market conflict/consistency governance.
- B05 patch scripts target accaBuilder.js and ACCA/card/final-flow/row-cleanup/SKCS-law behavior, creating overlap between runtime rule surfaces, smoke tests, and manual patch utilities.

Decision:
- Functional overlap is proven.
- No canonical ACCA/market rule authority is selected in Phase 5.
- No patch script is executed.
- No merge, deletion, retirement, or refactor is authorized.
- Carry forward as a future ACCA/rule-authority canonicalization candidate.

Candidate group 4: database/cache/job utility surfaces

Assets:
- backend/utils/db.js
- backend/utils/apiCache.js
- backend/utils/jobLogger.js
- backend/utils/purgeStaleData.js

Outcome:
- POTENTIAL_MERGE_GROUP

Evidence:
- backend/utils/db.js redirects to backend/db.js to prevent duplicate pools.
- backend/utils/apiCache.js creates its own pg Pool for API cache storage.
- backend/utils/jobLogger.js creates its own pg Pool for cron/job logging.
- backend/utils/purgeStaleData.js imports pool from backend/database.js and deletes stale prediction data.
- This creates proven overlap with the already-recorded B02-B03 database access authority candidate group.

Decision:
- Database/cache/job utility overlap is proven.
- No database authority is selected in Phase 5.
- No SQL is executed.
- No merge, deletion, refactor, or database mutation is authorized.
- Carry forward with the database access authority candidate group.

Candidate group 5: external provider access, quota, key, cache, and circuit-breaker utilities

Assets:
- backend/errors/ProviderQuotaExceededError.js
- backend/utils/apiCache.js
- backend/utils/apiQueue.js

- backend/providers/football/bsdProvider.js
- backend/providers/football/bzzoiroProvider.js
- backend/providers/football/soccerDataApiProvider.js
- backend/providers/football/sportsApiProFootballAdapter.js

Outcome:
- MAJOR_OVERLAP

Evidence:
- Multiple B04 utilities manage external API access concerns: cache, queueing, usage limiting, key pools, circuit breaking, provider quota errors, RapidAPI waterfall, availability, and weather enrichment.
- B06 provider files also implement external football provider access surfaces.
- The evidence proves broad provider-access overlap across utility and provider layers.
- Some overlap may be architectural layering, but the provider-access boundary is not singular.

Decision:
- Major provider-access overlap is proven.
- No provider retirement, deletion, dependency update, or security work is authorized.
- Carry forward as a future external-provider boundary/canonicalization candidate.

Candidate group 6: football provider and normalizer families

Assets:
- backend/providers/football/bigBallsDataProvider.js
- backend/providers/football/bigBallsDataNormalizer.js
- backend/providers/football/bsdProvider.js
- backend/providers/football/bsdNormalizer.js
- backend/providers/football/bzzoiroProvider.js

- backend/providers/football/soccerDataApiProvider.js
- backend/providers/football/soccerDataApiNormalizer.js
- backend/providers/football/sportsApiProFootballAdapter.js
- backend/providers/football/sportsApiProFootballNormalizer.js

Outcome:
- PARTIAL_OVERLAP

Evidence:
- B06 contains repeated provider/normalizer pairs for multiple football providers.
- The files share provider, provider fixture ID, league ID, event ID, and normalization vocabulary.
- Several providers explicitly state disabled or not connected to prediction/canonical ingest behavior.
- This proves repeated pattern overlap, but each provider/normalizer pair handles a different external source.

Decision:
- Keep separate for now.
- No merge group is selected solely because provider adapter patterns repeat.
- Carry forward as provider-boundary review evidence.

Candidate group 7: sports normalization and ingestion scripts

Assets:
- backend/parsers/base_sport_parser.py
- backend/workers/now_api_pulse.py
- backend/scripts/bridge_frontend.py

- backend/scripts/sync-sportsrc-fixtures.js
- backend/scripts/requirements.txt
- backend/utils/sportsrcNormalizer.js
- backend/audit/system_integrity_audit.md

Outcome:
- PARTIAL_OVERLAP

Evidence:
- Python scripts and parser/worker files share ingestion, Supabase, football, provider, and prediction-context vocabulary.
- backend/audit/system_integrity_audit.md documents ingestion-to-frontend gaps and Supabase compatibility.
- backend/scripts/ingest_football.py and populate_sports_data.py use Supabase and external football/sports data workflows.
- backend/scripts/sync-sportsrc-fixtures.js and backend/utils/sportsrcNormalizer.js relate to SportsRC fixture synchronization/normalization.

Decision:
- Functional relationship is proven, but same-job overlap is not fully proven by this scan.
- Keep separate.
- No script execution, deletion, or consolidation is authorized.

Distinct-role findings:
- backend/errors/ProviderQuotaExceededError.js is a provider quota error class; related to provider utilities but not a same-job provider adapter.
- backend/logic/edgeMind_manifest.json is EdgeMind logic metadata; no same-job B04-B06 file proven.
- backend/middleware/supabaseJwt.js is authentication/subscription middleware; no same-job B04-B06 file proven.
- backend/utils/auth.js is request key/role helper logic; related to authentication but not proven duplicate of supabaseJwt.js.
- backend/utils/contextInsights.js, dateNormalization.js, pipelineLogger.js, sportsrcNormalizer.js, weather.js, and availability.js each provide domain utility roles with partial pipeline/provider relationships only.
- backend/scripts/test_ai_providers.py and backend/scripts/test_ai_real_matches.py are AI provider/manual test scripts; no same-job B04-B06 merge group proven.

Batch decision:
- B04-B06 contains proven functional overlap candidates.
- Potential future canonicalization candidates are recorded for ACCA/rule authority, database/cache/job utilities, provider-access utilities, semantic boundary, and provider adapter families.
- No cleanup action is authorized by this outcome.
- B04-B06 Phase 5 evidence is closed.
- Next batch group: B07-B10.

Validation boundary:
- Evidence only.
- No deletion, merge, retirement, refactor, source/runtime/product change, SQL execution, deployment change, database/Supabase mutation, dependency update, or vulnerability remediation is authorized.

- No deployment config, autoDeploy setting, cron, route, build command, or environment variable is changed.
- Carry forward as deployment-surface boundary evidence.

Distinct-role findings:
- B23 SQL files are database-change artifacts and must not be merged, rewritten, or executed during Phase 5.
- Supabase functions are runtime/deployment assets and must not be deployed or repaired during this evidence pass.
- B24 tests are governance protection assets and repeated Control Center vocabulary alone does not authorize consolidation.
- B25 scratch scripts are mutation-capable and were not executed.
- B26 deployment configs overlap by hosting responsibility but are not identical jobs.

- Source evidence: PHASE 5 - B02-B03 FUNCTIONAL OVERLAP IDENTIFICATION EVIDENCE
- Start HEAD: d71adbe9
- Evidence type: canonical authority decision only
- Deletion/merge/retirement/refactor performed: NO
- Source/runtime/product change performed: NO
- SQL execution performed: NO
- Deployment change performed: NO
- Database/Supabase mutation performed: NO
- Dependency/security/vulnerability remediation performed: NO

Decision vocabulary used:
- CANONICAL_KEEP
- NEEDS_RUNTIME_PROOF

Candidate group 1: database access authority

Assets:
- backend/database.js
- backend/db.js
- backend/dbBootstrap.js

Phase 6 decisions:
- backend/db.js: CANONICAL_KEEP - general database access helper.
- backend/database.js: NEEDS_RUNTIME_PROOF - broad legacy/compatibility database surface.
- backend/dbBootstrap.js: CANONICAL_KEEP - database bootstrap/schema/seed authority only.

Evidence:
- backend/db.js is the focused database helper and exports pool, query, and withTransaction.
- backend/db.js has broad active use across controllers, routes, services, semantic-layer code, and backend/utils/db.js.
- backend/database.js is also active and is used by server-express.js, middleware, routes, utilities, and services.
- backend/database.js exports broader helper functions beyond basic database access, including prediction, profile, subscription, and accuracy helpers.
- backend/dbBootstrap.js imports query from backend/database.js and exports bootstrap.
- backend/dbBootstrap.js is used by server-express.js and force-seed.js as bootstrap/schema/seed authority, not as general database access authority.

Control decision:
- Keep backend/db.js as canonical general database helper.
- Keep backend/dbBootstrap.js as canonical bootstrap/schema/seed authority.
- Hold backend/database.js behind NEEDS_RUNTIME_PROOF before any replacement, merge, or retirement.

Candidate group 2: server inline endpoint versus route-module boundary

Phase 6 decisions:
- backend/server-express.js: CANONICAL_KEEP - server bootstrap, middleware, router mounting, and legacy inline endpoint host.
- backend/routes/pipeline.js: CANONICAL_KEEP - modular pipeline route authority.
- backend/routes/predictions.js: CANONICAL_KEEP - modular predictions route authority.
- backend/routes/debug.js: CANONICAL_KEEP - modular debug route authority.
- backend/routes/scheduler.js: CANONICAL_KEEP - modular scheduler route authority.
- backend/routes/cricketCron.js: CANONICAL_KEEP - modular cricket cron route authority.
- backend/routes/cricketInsights.js: CANONICAL_KEEP - modular cricket insights route authority.

- backend/routes/sportsEdge.js: CANONICAL_KEEP - modular sports edge public API route authority.
- backend/routes/v1/predictions.js: CANONICAL_KEEP - modular v1 predictions route authority.
- Inline server endpoints: NEEDS_RUNTIME_PROOF before any move, deletion, or replacement.

Evidence:
- server-express.js imports and mounts modular route files.
- server-express.js also still defines inline endpoints for pipeline trigger, refresh-predictions, debug sync-test, cron routes, cricket daily fixtures, master pipeline, AI predictions, and cricket table debug behavior.
- Candidate route modules all exist, define router endpoints, and export routers.
- Route-module overlap is therefore controlled but not safe to consolidate without live caller and route-contract proof.

Control decision:
- Keep server-express.js as bootstrap/mounting/legacy inline endpoint authority.
- Keep modular route files as canonical authorities for their mounted route domains.
- No inline endpoint may be moved, deleted, or replaced until frontend callers, scheduler URLs, deployment references, cron references, and route contracts are proven.

- backend/routes/v1/predictions.js is mounted under /api/v1 and exposes match, batch, and history prediction endpoints.
- backend/routes/user.js owns user/subscription-specific prediction access and insight consumption routes.
- backend/routes/vip.js owns VIP/stress prediction payload delivery.

- backend/routes/cricketCount.js: NEEDS_RUNTIME_PROOF - dedicated compatibility count endpoint.
- backend/deploy-trigger-cricket.js: CANONICAL_KEEP - external trigger caller, not route authority.
- backend/server-express.js inline cricket endpoints: NEEDS_RUNTIME_PROOF - legacy inline cricket cron/debug host.

Evidence:
- backend/routes/cricketCache.js owns the cricket cache read route and reads CricAPI cache through cricApiCacheService.
- backend/routes/cricketCron.js owns mounted modular cricket cron/cache endpoints for Cricbuzz and CricAPI.
- backend/routes/cricketInsights.js owns cricket insights delivery and also exposes a lightweight /count endpoint.
- backend/routes/cricketCount.js duplicates count-like behavior but is separately mounted at /api/cricket/count.

- backend/deploy-trigger-cricket.js: CANONICAL_KEEP - external cricket trigger caller, not route authority.
- backend/routes/cricketCron.js: CANONICAL_KEEP - modular cricket cron/cache route authority.
- backend/server-express.js /api/cron/cricket-daily-fixtures: NEEDS_RUNTIME_PROOF - inline cricket-daily-fixtures route host.

Evidence:
- backend/deploy-trigger.js calls /api/pipeline/run-full.
- backend/routes/pipeline.js defines GET and POST /run-full and is mounted at /api/pipeline.
- backend/deploy-trigger-cricket.js calls /api/cron/cricket-daily-fixtures.
- backend/routes/cricketCron.js defines modular /cricket/cricbuzz, /cricket/cricapi/daily, and /cricket/cricapi/live endpoints under /api/cron.
- server-express.js still owns the inline /api/cron/cricket-daily-fixtures endpoint and mounts both /api/pipeline and /api/cron route modules.

Control decision:
- Keep trigger files as external callers.

Per-asset Phase 7 decisions:

Core Control Center governance group:
- control-center/EDGE_BUILD_CONTROL_LEDGER.v1.json: NO_ACTION - machine ledger authority; Phase 5 partial overlap with policy/checker is intentional and no merge group was proven.
- control-center/EDGE_CONTROL_CENTER.md: NO_ACTION - operator governance document and structured state authority; consolidation would break active Control Center gate evidence.
- control-center/check_control_center.js: NO_ACTION - Phase 6 CANONICAL_KEEP governance checker; no safe consolidation path proven.

Asset classification and repository asset authority group:
- control-center/EDGE_ASSET_CLASSIFICATION_BATCHES.v1.json: NO_ACTION - deterministic batch manifest authority; must remain separate from register and checker surfaces.
- control-center/EDGE_REPOSITORY_ASSET_REGISTER.v1.json: NO_ACTION - governed asset register authority; Phase 5 keep-separate decision stands.
- control-center/check_edge_asset_classification.js: NO_ACTION - Phase 6 CANONICAL_KEEP governance checker; regenerates map but is not replaceable by register or manifest alone.
- control-center/EDGE_ASSET_REPOSITORY_MAP.md: NO_ACTION - generated human-readable projection; intentional derived output, not a merge candidate.

Project register projection group:
- control-center/EDGE_MASTER_PROJECT_REGISTER.v1.json: NO_ACTION - project register authority derived from ledger; Phase 5 projection overlap is expected.
- control-center/check_edge_project_register.js: NO_ACTION - ACTIVE governance checker validating and synchronizing register projections; no Phase 6 NEEDS_RUNTIME_PROOF hold and no merge proof.
- control-center/EDGE_PROJECT_BACKLOG.md: NO_ACTION - generated backlog projection; MANUAL_USE documentation output, not canonical merge target.
- control-center/EDGE_PROJECT_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md: NO_ACTION - generated dependency projection; MANUAL_USE documentation output, not canonical merge target.

Repository asset register checker:
- control-center/check_edge_repository_asset_register.js: NO_ACTION - ACTIVE governance checker for asset register integrity; distinct from classification and project register checkers.

Runtime inventory projection group:
- control-center/EDGE_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_INVENTORY.v1.json: NO_ACTION - machine-readable runtime inventory authority; Phase 5 keep-separate decision stands.
- control-center/check_edge_system_runtime_inventory.js: NO_ACTION - Phase 6 CANONICAL_KEEP governance checker; synchronizes map but remains distinct checker authority.
- control-center/EDGE_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_MAP.md: NO_ACTION - generated runtime review projection; intentional derived output, not a merge candidate.

Implementation actions performed:
- None.

No-action and hold summary:
- IMPLEMENT_CONSOLIDATION: 0 assets
- NO_ACTION: 15 assets
- HOLD_NEEDS_RUNTIME_PROOF: 0 assets

Why no B01 consolidation was authorized:
- Phase 5 recorded only controlled PARTIAL_OVERLAP across source/checker/projection surfaces and explicitly found no MAJOR_OVERLAP or POTENTIAL_MERGE_GROUP for B01.
- Phase 4 recorded all 15 B01 assets as CURRENT with no superseded or replaced authority.
- Phase 6 CANONICAL_KEEP decisions for three B01 checkers confirm they remain distinct governance authorities rather than merge targets.
- Merging ledger, register, manifest, checker, or generated projection surfaces would break active package.json control scripts, checker validation paths, and governed synchronization contracts without proven safety.

Explicit scope confirmation:
- B01 only.
- B02-B29 not inspected for implementation in this packet.
- No runtime/source files outside allowed governance evidence were changed.

Validation boundary:
- Evidence only.
- No deletion, merge, retirement, refactor, source/runtime/product change, SQL execution, deployment change, database/Supabase mutation, dependency update, or vulnerability remediation is authorized by this packet.

Grouped decision summary (B02 and B03 only):
- IMPLEMENT_CONSOLIDATION: 0 assets
- NO_ACTION: 38 assets
- HOLD_NEEDS_RUNTIME_PROOF: 3 assets (backend/database.js, backend/package-lock.json, backend/routes/cricketCount.js)

Why no B02/B03 consolidation was authorized:
- Phase 5 recorded overlap candidates across database access, server/route boundaries, prediction APIs, and cricket surfaces but explicitly authorized no merge, deletion, or refactor.
- Phase 6 assigned CANONICAL_KEEP to distinct runtime authorities and NEEDS_RUNTIME_PROOF holds where consolidation would be unsafe without live caller and contract proof.
- Merging database.js into db.js, consolidating cricketCount.js into cricketInsights.js, retiring package-lock.json, or moving inline server endpoints would violate Phase 6 holds and active deployment/caller references without proven safety.

Explicit scope confirmation:
- Grouped unit B01-B03 closed with B01 evidence carried forward unchanged.
- B02 and B03 newly inspected; B04-B29 not touched.
- No runtime/source files changed.

Batch decision:
- B01-B03 merge/consolidation gate is evidence-complete with NO_ACTION across carried-forward B01 and newly inspected B02/B03 assets except explicit HOLD_NEEDS_RUNTIME_PROOF carries.
- Grouped unit B01-B03 is closed.
- Phase 7 sequencing is now grouped: B01-B03 complete; next deterministic group B04-B06.

Validation boundary:
- Evidence only.
- No deletion, merge, retirement, refactor, source/runtime/product change, SQL execution, deployment change, database/Supabase mutation, dependency update, or vulnerability remediation is authorized by this packet.

NO_ACTION basis:
- Phase 6 selected canonical runtime/helper/provider/normalizer authorities that must remain separate.
- Phase 5 found functional overlap in several areas, but did not authorize merge, deletion, retirement, or refactor.
- Phase 4 identified three B04 LEGACY assets, but Phase 7 cannot remove or retire them without runtime proof and reference safety.
- Phase 6 placed scripts, audit/proof artifacts, parser/worker support surfaces, purge helper, and the shared provider adapter behind NEEDS_RUNTIME_PROOF.
- No safe B04-B06 consolidation path is proven in the current evidence.

Implementation actions performed:
- None.

Why no B04-B06 consolidation was authorized:
- Verification, semantic governance, ACCA/rule, database/cache/job, provider-access, provider/normalizer, and ingestion/script surfaces have layered or supporting roles.
- Canonical authority decisions keep core/runtime/provider/normalizer utilities separate.
- Runtime-proof holds prevent safe deletion, replacement, retirement, execution, or consolidation of support scripts, adapters, parser/worker surfaces, audit evidence, and purge helpers.
- Implementing consolidation now would risk breaking runtime callers, provider behavior, package scripts, database/cache paths, or manual/operator workflows without proof.

Explicit scope confirmation:
- B04-B06 only.
- B07-B29 not inspected for implementation in this packet.
- No runtime/source files changed.

Batch decision:
- B04-B06 merge/consolidation gate is evidence-complete with NO_ACTION for canonical/current assets and HOLD_NEEDS_RUNTIME_PROOF for held/legacy/support surfaces.
- Grouped unit B04-B06 is closed.
- Next deterministic group: B07-B10

Validation boundary:
- Evidence only.
- No deletion, merge, retirement, refactor, source/runtime/product change, SQL execution, deployment change, database/Supabase mutation, dependency update, or vulnerability remediation is authorized by this packet.
